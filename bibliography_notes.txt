Kinetic cooperativity resolves bidirectional clogging within the nuclear pore complex
@article{Zheng2024,
   abstract = {As the main gatekeeper of the nucleocytoplasmic transport in eukaryotic cells, the nuclear pore complex (NPC) faces the daunting task of facilitating the bidirectional transport of a high volume of macromolecular cargoes while ensuring the selectivity, speed, and efficiency of this process. The competition between opposing nuclear import and export fluxes passing through the same channel is expected to pose a major challenge to transport efficiency. It has been suggested that phase separation-like radial segregation of import and export fluxes within the assembly of intrinsically disordered proteins that line the NPC pore could be a mechanism for ensuring efficient bidirectional transport. We examine the impact of radial segregation on the efficiency of bidirectional transport through the NPC using a coarse-grained computational model of the NPC. We find little evidence that radial segregation improves transport efficiency. By contrast, surprisingly, we find that NTR crowding may enhance rather than impair the efficiency of bidirectional transport although it decreases the available space in the pore. We identify mechanisms of this novel crowding-induced transport cooperativity through the self-regulation of cargo density and flux in the pore. These findings explain how the functional architecture of the NPC resolves the problem of efficient bidirectional transport, and provide inspiration for the alleviation of clogging in artificial selective nanopores.},

"we find that NTR crowding may enhance rather than impair the efficiency of bidirectional transport although it decreases the available space in the pore"
we can justify it by sayning the change in adhesive strenghs may have more profound effect compared to decreased available space

The ‘‘nanomaterial’’ formed by the FG assembly acts as a barrier that restricts the diffusion of nonspecific macromolecules between the nucleus and cytoplasm in a size-dependent wa(17–20).

Upon binding to a cargo molecule, the resulting NTR-cargo complex is able to partition into the FG nup material and travel via a diffusion-like mechanism between the nuclear and cytoplasmic sides facilitated by multivalent weak binding interactions with FG nups (1,10,22–25).

To understand the basic principles of species segregation and pathway separation in the NPC channel, we use a minimal coarse-grained model, reported and validated in (29)

Visualizing the disordered nuclear transport
machinery in situ

Consequently, the protein conformational
state inside the NPC remains elusive, which has led to several partially
conflicting hypotheses for the morphologies of the FG domains in their
functional state22–28.

In this study, we developed a method to probe distance distribu-
tions of FG-NUPs inside the NPCs by combining fluorescence lifetime
imaging of fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FLIM–FRET)
The FLIM–FRET experiments assist MD simulations in providing us with
a 3D view of the organization of FG-NUPs in functional NPCs.

Owing to recent advances in determining the structure of the NPC
scaffold, the actual grafting points for the FG domains are now known
with high confidence4–11.

A key finding is that the ensembles of FG-NUPs within functional
nuclear pores inside cells are distinct from the chain ensembles sam-
pled in solution, untethered from the pore. The intriguing inference
presented is that the apparent solvent quality of the nuclear pore is bet-
ter than that of a bulk, aqueous solvent, with conformational statistics
measured in the pore resembling what one would observe in at least a
theta solvent (ν = 0.5) and more closely, a good solvent (ν > 0.5).

Nuclear transport surveillance of p53 by nuclear pores in glioblastoma

The nuclear envelope (NE) separates the nucleoplasm and the cytoplasm in eukaryotic cells. Nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) are cylindrical macromolecular apparatus embedded within the NE and consist of 30 proteins called nucleoporins (NUPs).1 NPCs govern biomolecule transport across the NE and operate as the sole gateway between the nucleus and the cytoplasm.2,3,4 Nuclear-cytoplasmic transport of macromolecules larger than ∼40 kDa is a systematic process whereby nuclear transport receptors and GTPase Ran collaboratively aid in the shuttle of these large proteins.5 Importin family members assist the nuclear entry of cargo that contain a nuclear localization signal (NLS), while the nuclear export process requires recognition of a nuclear export signal (NES) in the cargo by Exportin-1 (XPO1). Selective and transient interaction of these complexes with NPCs facilitates the canonical transport process.6,7,8,9,10,11

 Depletion of NUP107 inhibits the growth of GBM cell lines through p53 protein stabilization. Mechanistically, NPCs establish a p53 degradation platform via an export pathway coupled with 26S proteasome tethering.

   abstract = {The hallmark of eukaryotic cells is the nucleus that contains the genome, enclosed by a physical barrier known as the nuclear envelope (NE). On the one hand, this compartmentalization endows the eukaryotic cells with high regulatory complexity and flexibility. On the other hand, it poses a tremendous logistic and energetic problem of transporting millions of molecules per second across the nuclear envelope, to facilitate their biological function in all compartments of the cell. Therefore, eukaryotes have evolved a molecular “nanomachine” known as the Nuclear Pore Complex (NPC). Embedded in the nuclear envelope, NPCs control and regulate all the bi-directional transport between the cell nucleus and the cytoplasm. NPCs combine high molecular specificity of transport with high throughput and speed, and are highly robust with respect to molecular noise and structural perturbations. Remarkably, the functional mechanisms of NPC transport are highly conserved among eukaryotes, from yeast to humans, despite significant differences in the molecular components among various species. The NPC is the largest macromolecular complex in the cell. Yet, despite its significant complexity, it has become clear that its principles of operation can be largely understood based on fundamental physical concepts, as have emerged from a combination of experimental methods of molecular cell biology, biophysics, nanoscience and theoretical and computational modeling. Indeed, many aspects of NPC function can be recapitulated in artificial mimics with a drastically reduced complexity compared to biological pores. We review the current physical understanding of the NPC architecture and function, with the focus on the critical analysis of experimental studies in cells and artificial NPC mimics through the lens of theoretical and computational models. We also discuss the connections between the emerging concepts of NPC operation and other areas of biophysics and bionanotechnology.},

The internal structure of the transport channel is equally unique. Its walls are decorated with
11 multiple nucleoporins that contain highly flexible and dynamic intrinsically disordered regions
12 (IDRs), which form the transport environment within the NPC passageway (IDRs are also known
13 as natively unfolded or “unstructured” protein domains) [5,6,9,37–41]. The disordered nature of
14 the nucleoporins within NPC passageway makes it challenging to experimentally probe their
15 behavior at the relevant nanometer length and millisecond time scales. A major drawback arises
16 from the high spatial and temporal mobility of the IDRs making them largely inaccessible to
17 classical methods, such as X-ray crystallography and (cryo)-electron tomography, as these rely on
18 ensemble averaging of individual conformations to obtain structural information. Although
19 alternative techniques, such as atomic force microscopy (AFM), super-resolution microscopy ,
20 intra-cellular FRET and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy, have started to resolve the
21 morphology and the dynamics of the transport channel in intact NPCs [42–48], much of our
22 knowledge about the nuclear pore still derives from in vitro studies of its components and their
23 assemblies, interpreted via computational and theoretical models. As a result, computational and
24 theoretical modeling have been a key part in understanding the role of the intrinsically disordered
25 protein domains in the NPC function

Theoretical models have enabled rigorous investigation of various ideas and concepts of NPC
28 function, facilitating quantitative interpretations of experimental data and providing predictions to
29 guide the development of future experiments. To develop an adequate description of the NPC
30 machinery, ongoing efforts have drawn upon a rich combination of ideas, theoretical concepts and
31 simulation techniques. These span equilibrium and non-equilibrium statistical mechanics,
32 stochastic process theory, polymer physics, and simulation techniques ranging from explicit
33 atomistic molecular dynamics to coarse grained polymer models [49–63]. In combination,
34 biophysical techniques and theoretical approaches are starting to reveal fundamental insights into
35 the organization and the dynamics of the NPC at the nanoscale.

Unlike the more familiar structured proteins, the intrinsically disordered regions of the FG nups
3 do not fold into defined three-dimensional structures. Hence, in many respects they behave as
4 conventional polymers [37,39,53,56,57,73,74]. 

Each NPC contains about 200-300 FG nups per pore, spread
6 among 10-15 different types that can differ in their amino acid sequence and localization within
7 the NPC [9,10,19,22].

##Size hinders transport##
larger molecules and particles are
34 progressively hindered from entering and translocating through the NPC with increasing size [75–
35 77].

##DIFFUSION##
Inside the NPC passageway, the translocation of transport protein/cargo complexes is primarily a
38 diffusive process, driven by thermal fluctuations and facilitated by the interactions with the FG
39 nups [6,78–80]. Each individual translocation of a transport protein/cargo complex occurs without
40 requiring direct input of energy, e.g., in the form of ATP or GTP hydrolysis, and typically takes

1 on the order of several milliseconds [78,81]. Yet, macroscopically, NPC translocation is a part of
2 the transport cycle that operates as a thermodynamic pump that concentrates cargoes inside the
3 nucleus against their chemical potential gradient.

The RanGTP7 bound transport protein is free to translocate back to the cytoplasm, as illustrated in Figure 4 [6,9].
RanGTP is also known to catalyze the release of some of the transport proteins from
9 the FG nups located at the nuclear basket, further enhancing the transport efficiency [43,80,83,84]

Notably, in the operational NPC transport cycle, energy input in the form of GTP
25 hydrolysis is not directly coupled to any molecular rearrangement of the NPC, unlike in many
26 other familiar molecular motors and pumps (such as processive motors, ion exchangers, and
27 ATPases) [90].
28

Overall, each NPC can contain
22 hundreds of transport proteins at any given time, while transporting hundreds of cargoes persecond
23 [7,43,83,85].

Faced with this complexity, a number of different models have evolved in the field to address
35 different aspects of NPC operation, ranging in focus from the general principles of the molecular
36 transport on the nanoscale as revealed in in vitro NPC mimics, to the emphasis on the particular
37 molecular mechanisms and structures as central to NPC transport [49,50,84,95–103]. Based on
38 these ideas, the combined experimental and the theoretical work of the last decade has started to
39 provide a comprehensive physical picture of NPC organization and function, within which
40 molecular details and functional principles fall into place

Functionally, FG nups play a twofold role: they form a template for the binding of cargo-carrying
9 transport proteins in the NPC while simultaneously forming a permeability barrier against
10 macromolecules that do not specifically bind the FG motifs. The exact nature of this barrier has
11 been extensively debated, in particular whether it is based mainly on entropic forces
12 [73,75,102,113] or whether it arises from breaking the attractive FG-FG interactions between the
13 chains[97,109]. In general, the balance between the role of the chain entropy versus chain cohesion
14 in the barrier has been unclear; and more recent studies emphasize that both are likely to play an
15 important role [56,57,108,114].

Flory theory predictions, in many cases
13 it serves as a very good approximation, and has been the staple of the analysis of polymer chain
14 behavior, and more recently protein IDRs [131,132].

Investigated through computer simulations using Brownian and Langevin dynamics, as well as
18 through various mean field and self-consistent field theories, simple homopolymer models have
19 been a staple of the computational studies of the NPC and its components, and provided important
20 insights into FG nup behavior [54,56,57,60,61,75]

At the opposite limit to simple homopolymer models, atomistic molecular dynamics (MD)
25 simulations have the potential to give atomically resolved interaction profiles and conformational
26 ensembles of FG nups [53,55,133-136]

A meta-analysis of a wider set of FG nups shows that on average,
24 the FG nup dimensions agree with predictions for "ideal" Gaussian chains with 𝜈𝜈 = 0.5, where
25 repulsive and attractive interactions are balanced [74]. 

[155]. These experiments yielded a mean persistence length of 0.39 ± 0.14 nm for this FG nup,
12 comparable to the size of an individual amino acid (~0.4 nm). At length scales beyond the
13 persistence length, angular correlations become negligible and the polymer behaves as a flexible
14 chain.

How interacting particles diffuse within the interior of such a complex
2 polymeric material still remains an open problem [52,257-270].

Although still not fully understood, multivalency likely helps to reconcile strong thermodynamic
15 binding with the fast mobility of transport proteins in an FG nup milieu. At higher FG nup
16 densities, single particles start to interact with multiple FG nups, allowing the transport proteins to
17 slide in a "millipede-type" motion from one chain to another while breaking only a small number
18 of bonds and remaining tightly bound to the FG nup assembly. Molecular dynamics simulations
19 have provided insights and visualizations of this "slide-and-exchange" mechanism for transport
20 protein motion within an FG nup assembly. In this model, only one binding site is released at each
21 step, enabling the transport protein to progress forward due to the thermal fluctuations of the FG
22 nups, finishing the step with the rebinding at the next available binding site [134]. This way, the
23 transport proteins can have high thermodynamic affinity for the FG nups while maintaining fast
24 kinetics [134]

4.1.4.4. Transport protein crowding inside the channel
15 Given that the NPC transports multiple molecules simultaneously [88,303,304] and is
16 continuously occupied by multiple transport proteins [43,83,305], the single-molecule analyses in
17 the previous section may not adequately account for the crowded conditions that apply in the NPC.
On the other hand, there are many other proteins in the dense
21 environment of the cell, present at concentrations that may be several orders of magnitude higher
22 than those of transport proteins, and that can interact with the NPC non-specifically [103,206,222].
23 Yet these are efficiently filtered out, without clogging the NPC. In the more general context, the
24 question of specificity and throughput in the presence of non-specific competition is important for
25 the design of artificial nano-channels and biosensors that are capable of molecular sorting and
26 detection under realistic conditions without fouling [193,306,307].

computational predictions [63] shown in Figure 33, which indicate that transport probability may
21 be tuned through the balance between hydrophobic and charged residues on the cargo surface.
22 Taken together, these experimental data and their theoretical analysis indicate that the specificity
23 of the transport protein/FG nup interaction relies on the balance of hydrophobic and charged
24 interactions

First characterization of the dynamics of translocation of individual transport proteins originated
8 from single molecule tracking in [78,324], and [81,91] (Figure 33) and established two important
9 points. First, they directly confirmed that the translocation of transport proteins is a stochastic
10 process, consistent with the model of thermally activated diffusion. In particular, it was observed
11 that the translocations can be abortive whereby the transport protein returns to the cytoplasm rather
12 than translocating into the nucleus. Second, the observed translocation times obeyed a distribution
13 with an exponential tail, with a characteristic decay time ofseveral millisecondsfor both successful
14 and abortive events. Notably, NPC mimics have been able to recapitulate these the durations of
15 translocation events (Section 4.1.2), indicating that they capture the most salient features of NPC
16 transport dynamics

Musser and coworkers [220] used a large tetrameric protein complex with a total molecular weight
24 465 kDa, or approximately 10 nm in diameter. Each subunit carried one NLS, which allowed to
25 load different numbers of transport proteins onto the construct and thus tune the strength of its
26 interaction with the NPC. Using single molecule fluorescent microscopy, translocating complexes
27 could then be tracked individually in permeabilized cell assays. This provided information about
28 spatial densities and distributions of the accumulated cargoes in the NPC under different

1 experimental conditions, such as the presence or absence of RanGTP, including statistics of
2 successful and abortive transport events and their translocation times. The results were analyzed
3 in terms of diffusion in the effective potential model described in Section 4.1.4. The inferred
4 effective potential showed a barrier in the middle of the pore along the transport axis, and two
5 potential wells at the nuclear and the cytoplasmic “vestibules” of the NPC. When the number of
6 transport proteins attached to the cargo was increased, the barrier became lower due to stronger
7 interaction of the construct with the FG nups, in accord with the expectations. Addition of RanGTP
8 to the system increased the transport, likely caused by the reduction of the potential at the nuclear
9 vestibule. This observation is consistent with RanGTP function of catalyzing the release of the
10 cargoes from the NPC.

In a complementary approach, Weis, Liphardt and co-workers used quantum dot nanoparticles,
13 conjugated with up to ~40 transport proteins, resulting in a construct of 30-40 nm in size [325].
14 The transport and translocation of the nanoparticle through the NPC was tracked using optical
15 (fluorescence) microscopy. The quantum dot experiments are in good agreement with previous
16 experiment and also support the existence of the permeability barrier/bottleneck at the center of
17 the pore flanked by “docking” areas on the nuclear and cytoplasmic sides (see also Figure 20).

More recently, [326] used very large cargoes based on viral capsids that can reach up to 30 nm in
19 diameter and carry up to 100 NLS attached transport proteins. These studies support the previously
20 identified general trends - import efficiency increased with the number of transport proteins, and
21 larger cargoes required more attached proteins for efficient transport than the smaller ones.
22 Analysis of these results in terms of transport in an effective potential similar to [220] was also
23 consistent with the existence of a central free energy barrier and a cytoplasmic
24 “docking”/“vestibule” regions.

Unlike the case of many other protein transporters, protein translocation through the NPC does not
22 occur one-by-one. Due to their affinity to the NPC interior, transport proteins tend to accumulate
23 within the pore, as illustrated in Figure 35, which shows enrichment of the fluorescently labeled
24 transport protein NTF2 within the nuclear envelope [23]. Similar accumulation can also be
25 observed for other transport proteins, such as Importin-β, with tens and possibly hundreds present
26 simultaneously in the NPC (e.g., [43]). Furthermore, NPC contains many different types of
27 transport proteins, and is engaged in bi-directional processes, including cargo-carrying import
28 proteins translocating into the nucleus, RanGTP-bound import proteins returning to the cytoplasm,
29 export proteins, and mRNA export particles [6,9].
30
31 While the presence of multiple transport proteins increases the NPC throughput on the one hand,
32 it also has a potential to block the pore. It remains to be fully understood how the NPC is able to
33 maintain high throughput and selective bi-directional transport under such conditions, and
34 different investigations provide somewhat contradictory evidence. One of the proposed solutions
35 has been a separation of transport pathways either through differential usage of different FG nups
36 types by different transport protein types, or by spatial segregation on the nanoscale
37 [43,44,83,100,101,173,252,253,324,334]; other mechanisms, such as dynamical switching
38 between export and import, have been proposed as well [281]. However, a consensus picture is
39 still lacking, with a number of controversies and discrepancies arising from different experiments.
40 We briefly summarize the current state of the art.

3 labeled transport protein NTF2 in the cytoplasm. Bottom: after 30 minutes, significant fraction of the transport proteins

Overall, the directionality of the transport cycle relies on the consumption of GTP and on the
27 asymmetry in the nucleo-cytoplasmic partitioning of the protein Ran, with its RanGDP form being
28 abundant in the cytoplasm and its RanGTP form being abundant in the nucleus. This asymmetric
29 distribution of Ran relies on the asymmetric distribution of RanGAP and RanGEF, two factors
30 responsible for GTP hydrolysis in the cytoplasm and GDP-to-GTP exchange in the nucleus,
31 respectively [5,339]. The complete nucleo-cytoplasmic exchange cycle comprises three inter32 linked loops, shown Figure 36. These loops are the import cycle, the export cycle, and the
33 NTF2/Ran cycle that is responsible for recycling of RanGDP into the nucleus and for the
34 maintenance of the RanGTP/GTP gradient.

The key steps of membrane fabrication are discussed, namely the deposition into thin films, functionalization of pores, and the secondary crosslinking of pre-existing microgel particles into membranes. The latter may be free-standing and do not necessitate the presence of a porous support layer. The temperature-dependent swelling properties of polymers provide a means of controlling the size of pores, and thus size-sensitive gating. Throughout the review, we highlight “positive” (gates open) or “negative” (closed) gating effects with respect to increasing temperature. In the second part, the functionalization of porous organic or inorganic membranes of various origins by either microgel particles or linear polymer brushes is discussed. In this case, the key steps are the adsorption or grafting mechanisms. Finally, whenever provided by the authors, the suitability of smart gating membranes for specific applications is highlighted.},

Before their import, NLS-cargo-kap complexes constantly form in the cytoplasm. When transported into
the nucleus, the high concentration of RanGTP then favors
the release of cargos. This is an exothermic reaction that
results in a lower final energy state (Figure 4c). The
resulting concentration gradient of cargo-kap drives
the complexes into the nucleus. Cargos accumulate in
the nucleus because they become 'trapped' there (Box 2)
[2,7,38]. In addition, the nuclear kap-RanGTP complexes,
which are produced during import, form a concentration
gradient decreasing towards the cytoplasm; these complexes probably diffuse into the cytoplasm (through NPC
binding), where RanGAP facilitates the hydrolysis of
RanGTP to RanGDP and the dissociation of Ran from
kap (Figure 1). Similarly, export kaps form complexes with
RanGTP and their NES-cargos in the nucleus and diffuse
down a concentration gradient into the cytoplasm where
RanGAP dissociates the complexes and releases their
cargos. This increases the cytoplasmic concentrations
of RanGDP and free kaps. It seems that free kaps, still
competent for NPC binding, can rapidly diffuse across the
NPC [39]. This would allow them to pass between the
nucleus and cytoplasm and scour each compartment for
new cargos [2]. Thus, the hydrolysis of GTP maintains
the diffusion gradients that ultimately force cargos to
concentrate on one or other side of the NE.
Were nucleocytoplasmic transport this simple - just a
matter of entropic barriers, NPC binding and GTPrenewed concentration gradients – then it should be
possible (in accordance with Le Chatelier's principle) to
reverse the normal direction of transport through the
NPC. Indeed, in agreement with these simple tenets, such
reversal has been demonstrated [40].

are also the binding sites for transport factors. Interestingly, the predicted multitude of low-affinity binding sites
for transport factors corresponds to what is observed, as
the ,200 FG nups at the NPC are themselves made of
multiple repeats of FG-binding sites, each with a relatively
low affinity and a high exchange rate [2,8,33-35]. This
provides hundreds of potential stepping stones across
which transport factors can pass. The multiplicity of
binding sites could also provide the NPC with the
necessary capacity to bind to many transport factors
simultaneously, allowing high transport flux.
Given the close proximity of so many FG repeats at the
NPC, transport factors might interact with several FG
repeats simultaneously. The potential even exists for a
transport factor to travel 'hand-over-fist' between repeats
across the NPC, always holding on to at least one FG
repeat. Thus, it is not so much affinities, but avidities - the
functional affinity resulting from the interaction between
two molecules through multiple binding sites - that we
might have to consider when attempting to derive a
molecular kinetic description of the NPC [2].
