\subsection*{Brief summary of the computation routines}

The paper is naturally split between the main text and Supplementary Information. 
The main results, condensed description and simplified formalism are presented in the main text.
An extended explanation of used method and routines are presented here for the interested readers. 

Each of the methods used in this paper has their shortcomings, we put our best efforts to forego this shortcomings, by combining different approaches in a complimentary manner. 
To reflect it, the next narrative goes together with a roadmap of the paper in Figure \ref{fig:paper_roadmap}.

Let us start from the end, the particular interest of the paper was to calculate resistance $R$ of a cylindrical mesopore in a membrane to a diffusion of nanocolloid particles. 
The inner surface of the pore is decorated with a densely grafted to the inner surface polymer chains forming polymer brush, which modulates the nanocolloid transport in a complex manner.

The presence of polymer brush introduce changes in local diffusion coefficient $D$ compared to diffusion coefficient in the pure solvent $D_0$, the short-range interaction of polymer with the solvent and colloid particle creates free landscape.

To find nanocolloid flux through such pore and the pore resistance the problem is formulated as massless particle diffusion in potential field, depending on the context applicable equations can be called Focker-Plank equation in the limit of strong friction, advection-diffusion or drift-diffusion equation and finally Smouluchowsky diffusion equation.
We are interested in stationary solution $\partial c_t = 0$ of the Smouluchowsky equation.

The key components to define the Smouluchowsky equation are local diffusion coefficient $D$ and insertion free energy $\Delta F$ (potential field). 

Local diffusion coefficient depends on the polymer volume concentration $\phi$ and particle size. 
The polymer brush forms polymer solution with a concentration dependent correlation length $\xi$. 
Particles with a size $d>\xi$ experience additional friction of the polymer mesh. 
As a result, the diffusion is slowed down compared to the pure solvent $D_0/D<1$.

The effect were studied and several models were proposed [refs\dots]. 
In this paper we chose the model proposed by the authors in [\dots].
The models assumes a non-sticky particles, and tend to overestimate diffusion coefficient for the particles with high affinity to the polymer.

As we mentioned before, the second component to define Smouluchowsky equation is insertion free energy. 
When a nanocolloid particle is inserted in a brush the free energy of the system is changed compared to the particle in the bulk solution. 

Insertion free energy can be split in two terms: osmotic $F_{\textrm{osm}}$ and surface $F_{\textrm{sur}}$; that scales with the particle volume and surface, respectively.

To calculate the osmotic term the Flory osmotic pressure is integrated over particle volume, that depends on local polymer volume concentration $\phi$ and polymer-solvent interaction parameter $\chi_{\textrm{PS}}$.
The surface contribution is proportional to the particle surface, with surface tension coefficient $\gamma$ and found by performing integration over the particle surface.

Surface tension coefficient $\gamma(\phi, \chi_{\textrm{PS}}, \chi_{\textrm{PC}})$ has non trivial dependency on the local polymer volume concentration, polymer-solvent interaction parameter $\chi_{\textrm{PS}}$ and polymer-colloid interaction parameter $\chi_{\textrm{PC}}$.
The problem become even more complex as the polymer volume concentration $\phi$ in the vicinity of the inserted particle distorted compared to the empty brush $\phi^{\textrm{empty}}$, forming depletion region $\Delta \phi <0$ for inert and slightly attractive particles and regions enriched with polymer $\Delta \phi >0$ for attractive particles ($\Delta \phi = \phi - \phi^{\textrm{empty}}$).

To our best knowledge there is now general purely analytical solution to calculate surface tension coefficient $\gamma$ for a given particle size and local polymer concentration $\phi$.
To account for local distortion in the polymer volume concentration $\phi$ we introduce correction to volume concentration of the empty brush $\phi^{\textrm{empty}}$ with coefficient $b_0, b_1$, making apparent $\phi^{\ast}$ volume concentration dependent on the polymer-colloid interaction parameter $\chi_{\textrm{PC}}$ to compute corrected surface tension coefficient $\gamma(\phi^{\ast},\chi_{\textrm{PS}}, \chi_{\textrm{PC}})$.

The correction coefficient can be found by fitting procedure if particle size $d$, polymer concentration profile $\phi$ and interaction parameters $\chi_{\textrm{PS}}, \chi_{\textrm{PC}}$ are known.

Yet within the chosen framework insertion free energy $\Delta F$ for a spherical particle with an arbitrary diameter $d$ and coordinates of the center $z_c, r_c$ is not accessible and we still miss local polymer concentration of the empty undisturbed polymer brush $\phi^{\textrm{empty}}$ to calculate osmotic pressure $\Pi$ and surface tension coefficient $\gamma$.
This motivates to employ another approach to calculate missing features, in this paper Scheutjens-Fleer Self-Consistent Field (SF-SCF) approach is utilized.

SF-SCF numerical method can be used to find equilibrium distribution of chain molecules.
In this method the space is discretized into regular lattice, the average volume fraction of the molecules is calculated in each lattice site, such that overall system free energy is minimized.
Nanocolloid particles and the membrane is defined as lattice cells impermeable for a polymer with some surface affinity to the polymer.
The natural choice for a pore is a cylindrical coordinate system, as the system has the axial symmetry, the coordinate system has a degenerate angular coordinate.
Not to break axial symmetry of the cylindrical pore, only cylindrical particles can embedded in the polymer brush coaxial with the system's main axis.

The results of SF-SCF are local polymer concentrations $\phi, \phi^{\textrm{empty}}$ and insertion free energy $\Delta F_{\textrm{SF}}$ of a cylindrical particle with an arbitrary axial coordinate $z$ and fixed radial coordinate $r=0$. 
Obviously, it is not the same as insertion free energy of a spherical particle with an arbitrary position $\Delta F$.
Primarily, using this data we perform the mapping insertion between them, by fitting correction coefficients $b_0, b_1$.

Finally, the roadmap in Figure \ref{fig:paper_roadmap} starts with control parameters that defines geometrical features of the pore, polymer brush morphology, particle size and interaction parameters.

        Schematic illustration of colloid particle interaction and diffusive transport through a pore filled with polymer brush. 
        The brush is formed by linear polymer chains (red strands) with a degree of polymerization $N$, uniformly grafted with grafting density $\sigma$  
        to the inner surface of a cylindrical pore in an impermeable membrane. The pore radius is $r_{pore}$ and the thickness of the membrane is $s$.
        Polymer chains are flexible with a statistical segment length $a$ and volume $\sim a^3$.
        \\
        The local mobility of the particles in the solvent $D/D_{0}$ is defined by their size ($d$), the presence of polymer chains impedes colloid transport by decreasing local mobility.
        % When a colloid placed in the brush it changes system free energy, which interprets in local insertion free energy.
        % The negative landscape of local insertion free facilitates colloid transport, whilst free energy barrier can halt the transport.
        The local insertion free energy arise from the contact of colloid particle with brush, and depends on Flory interaction parameters $\chi$ (upper inset).
