  abstract  = {We use scaling theory to derive the time dependence of the mean-square displacement 〈Δr2〉 of a probe nanoparticle of size d experiencing thermal motion in polymer solutions and melts. Particles with size smaller than solution correlation length undergo ordinary diffusion (〈Δr2(t)〉 ∼ t) with diffusion coefficient similar to that in pure solvent. The motion of particles of intermediate size (< d < a), where a is the tube diameter for entangled polymer liquids, is subdiffusive (〈Δr2(t)〉 ∼ t1/2) at short time scales since their motion is affected by subsections of polymer chains. At long time scales the motion of these particles is diffusive, and their diffusion coefficient is determined by the effective viscosity of a polymer liquid with chains of size comparable to the particle diameter d. The motion of particles larger than the tube diameter a at time scales shorter than the relaxation time τe of an entanglement strand is similar to the motion of particles of intermediate size. At longer time scales (t > τe) large particles (d > a) are trapped by entanglement mesh, and to move further they have to wait for the surrounding polymer chains to relax at the reptation time scale τrep. At longer times t > τrep, the motion of such large particles (d > a) is diffusive with diffusion coefficient determined by the bulk viscosity of the entangled polymer liquids. Our predictions are in agreement with the results of experiments and computer simulations. © 2011 American Chemical Society.},

  abstract  = {The viscosity in soft matter systems is a scale dependent quantity. In polymer solutions the viscosity of nanoprobes of size R approaches the macroscopic viscosity when R exceeds the radius of gyration of the polymer, Rg. The nano to macroviscosity crossover occurs for R ∼ Rg. Here we analyze diffusion in a polymer (polyethylene glycol) solution of nanoparticles in the crossover regime. We report a scale dependent diffusion coefficient in this regime due to non-uniform viscosity in the depletion layer around particles. The phenomenological scaling of the slow diffusion coefficient as a function of probe size is compared to the same scaling for macroscopic viscosity as a function of polymer size.},

Based on three assumptions: (i) the dominant polymer-polymer interaction is hydrodynamic, even in concentrated solutions, topological/entanglement forces providing only secondary corrections; (ii) the effect of successive polymer concentration increments is adequately treated with a self-similarity approximation; and (iii) large polymers shrink with increasing concentration, the model obtains correct concentration and molecular-weight dependences for the polymer self-diffusion coefficient.

  abstract  = {Flows around small colloidal particles of diameter b, or in thin films, capillaries, etc., cannot always be described in terms of the macroscopic polymer viscosity. We discuss these features for entangled polymer melts, where two distinct regimes can be found: (a) the thin regime where b is smaller than the coil radius R0, but larger than the diameter dt of the Edwards tube; (b) the ultrathin regime, where b < dt. We consider (i) non adsorbing particles, where slippage may occur between the melt and the solid surface; (ii) "hairy" particles, which carry some bound polymer chains. We obtain scaling predictions for mobilities of spheres, of needles, and of clusters of particles. We also discuss translational and rotational diffusion of needles.},

@article{Tu2011,
   abstract = {Molecular traffic between the cytoplasm and the nucleoplasm of eukaryotic cells is mediated by nuclear pore complexes (NPCs). Hundreds, if not thousands, of molecules interact with and transit through each NPC every second. The pore is blocked by a permeability barrier, which consists of a network of intrinsically unfolded polypeptides containing thousands of phenylalanine-glycine (FG) repeat motifs. This FG-network rejects larger molecules and admits smaller molecules or cargos bound to nuclear transport receptors (NTRs). For a cargo transport complex, minimally consisting of a cargo molecule plus an NTR, access to the permeability barrier is provided by interactions between the NTR and the FG repeat motifs. Numerous models have been postulated to explain the controlled accessibility and the transport characteristics of the FG-network, but the amorphous, flexible nature of this structure has hindered characterization. A relatively recent development is the ability to monitor the real-time movement of single molecules through individual NPCs via single molecule fluorescence (SMF) microscopy. A major advantage of this approach is that it can be used to continuously monitor a series of specific molecular interactions in an active pore with millisecond time resolution, which therefore allows one to distinguish between kinetic and thermodynamic control. Novel insights and prospects for the future are outlined in this review.
