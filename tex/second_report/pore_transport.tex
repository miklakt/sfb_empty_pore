        Schematic illustration of colloid particle interaction scenario and diffusive transport through a polymer brush pore. 
        The brush (red strands) with a degree of polymerization $N$, grafting density $\sigma$ and polymer segment length $a$ is grafted to the inner surface of a cylindrical pore in an impermeable membrane. The pore has the radius $r_{pore}$ and the thickness $s$.
        The membrane (grey) separates semi-infinite solvent (blue) reservoirs such that any transport occur through the pore. 
        Transport of colloid particles (green hue) is affected by the brush in a complex manner.
        The local mobility of the particles in the solvent $D_{0}$ is defined by their size ($d$), the presence of polymer chains impedes colloid transport by decreasing local mobility.
        When a colloid placed in the brush it changes system free energy, which interprets in local insertion free energy.
        The negative landscape of local insertion free facilitates colloid transport, whilst free energy barrier can halt the transport.
        The local insertion free energy arise from the contact of colloid particle with brush, and depends on Flory interaction parameters $\chi$ (lower inset). To calculate insertion free energy polymer brush, solvent and particle coarse-grained into regular elements (upper inset) having finite volume and contact area.

In this work we consider a system schematically shown in Figure \ref{fig:colloid_transport}. We consider a membrane with thickness $s$ perforated by a cylindrical pore with radius $r$. %with a polymer brush grafted to the inner surface.
The membrane separates two semi-infinite reservoirs and impermeable for polymer and colloid particles. 

Polymer chains with degree of polymerization $N$, segment length $\sigma$, segment volume $\sigma$ are densely grafted to the inner surface of the pore forming polymer brush.

\end{figure}

Consider cylindrical coordinate system with the origin in the pore center (Figure \ref{fig:coordinate_system}), as the system exhibit axial symmetry with respect to pore main axis, polymer brush properties uniform along angular coordinate.
Thus, all system properties are three dimensional they are represented as two dimensional profiles $f(z,r)$.

Depending on solvent quality polymer brush swell/deswell. 
In good solvent swollen brush fills not only the pore but also protrudes outside the pore. In poor solvent, polymer brush deswell and in the case of sufficiently large pore may form open channel free of polymer [CITE].

Solvent quality is controlled by Flory-Huggins parameter $\chi_{PS}$, subscript PS denotes polymer-solvent interaction. The value $\chi_{PS}<0.5$ corresponds to good solvent, $\chi_{PS}>0.5$ corresponds to poor solvent, and $\chi_{PS}=0.5$ corresponds to $\theta-$solvent.
The swell/deswell behavior of a brush depending on solvent quality illustrated on Figure \ref{fig:phi_hm_grid}, \ref{fig:phi_center}.

In the Figure \ref{fig:phi_hm_grid} first two frames corresponds to a swollen polymer brush in a good solvent $\chi_{PS}<0.5$, and the third one to a $\theta$-solvent $\chi_{PS}=0.5$. 
For those conditions a large portion of the brush is outside the pore.
Polymer brush in a good and $\theta$-solvent has wide region with polymer concentration smoothly decays, note the wide yellow halo in the first three frames in Figure \ref{fig:phi_hm_grid}.

In a moderately poor solvent $\chi_{PS}=0.7$ the brush still protrudes outside the pore, however, the transition between the brush and solvent is more sharp, as one can see in the Figure \ref{fig:phi_hm_grid} as a yellow halo.
In the poor solvent the brush collapses inside the pore forming concave dish-like surface with a step-like change in polymer density (small correlation length).

These effects are illustrated in the Figure \ref{fig:phi_center}, which traces the evolution of polymer density profiles along the pore's main axis $z$. 
Polymer brush in a good and $\theta$-solvent exhibit slow smooth change in polymer density when moving along $z$-axis, the polymer density profiles are wide bell-like curves with wide tails.
In a poor solvent solvent polymer brush exhibit sharp transition in polymer concentration when moving along $z$-axis, with a box-like curves.


Colloid particles has a bulk concentration $c_0$ in one of the reservoirs and allowed to diffuse into the other reservoir with pure solvent only through the pore.
Colloid particle interaction with solvent and polymer are very complex, we consider approximate model, where the particle has homogenous surface with a given affinity to polymer and solvent.
When a particle come into contact with a polymer, the contact colloid-solvent (CS) and polymer-solvent (PS) are substituted to the contact polymer-colloid (PC).
The particles, approximated with a sphere with diameter $d$, the affinity to the polymer is controlled with Flory-Huggins interaction parameter $\chi_{PC}$, where subscript PC denotes polymer-colloid interaction. Without loss in generality $\chi_{CS}=0.0$, where subscript PS denotes colloid-solvent interaction.

\subsection{Colloid insertion free energy}
\subsubsection*{Analytical method}
When a colloid particle is moved from the bulk solvent into the brush, there is a change in free energy $\Delta F$, which defines insertion free energy penalty. A positive $\Delta F$ thus implies that the brush repels the colloid, and vice versa.

For a relatively small particles insertion free energy $\Delta F(z,r)$ can be defined as a sum of two contributions: osmotic $\Delta F_{osm}(z,r)$ and surface $\Delta F_{sur}(z,r)$ free energy.

To calculate osmotic and surface terms, one has to integrate polymer brush osmotic pressure profile over colloid particle volume and surface tension coefficient over colloid particle surface.

\begin{eqnarray}
    \Delta F(z,r) = \Delta F_{osm} + \Delta F_{sur}
    \\
    \Delta F_{osm} = \int_{V} \Pi dV
    \\
    \Delta F_{sur} = \int_{S} \Pi dS
\end{eqnarray}

Local osmotic pressure is calculated from local polymer density
\begin{equation}
	\Pi(z,r)=  \phi(z,r)\frac{\partial f\{\phi(z,r)\}}{\partial \phi(z,r)} - f\{\phi(z,r)\}= 
	k_BT[-\ln(1-\phi(z,r)) - \phi(z,r) -\chi_{PS}\phi^2(z,r)]
\end{equation}

The surface tension coefficient is approximated as
\begin{eqnarray}
    \gamma = \frac{1}{6}(\chi_{ads} - \chi_{crit})\phi^{\ast}
    \\
    \chi_{ads} = \chi_{PC} - \chi_{PS}(1-\phi^{\ast})
    \\
    \phi^{\ast}= (b_{0} + b_{1}\chi_{PC})\phi
\end{eqnarray}
the coefficient $\gamma$ is interpreted as an free energy excess/deficiency when a contact of colloid with the pure solvent replaced by a contact with polymer solution.

\todo{Add some physical insight on $1/6$ and $\chi_{crit}$.}

When the particle placed into the brush, it creates a region depleted from polymer, if the particle is substantially attractive the region is enriched in polymer.
Coefficients $b_0$ and $b_1$ are introduced to account proximal to colloid particle depletion/accumulation of polymer, thus corrects local polymer concentration of an empty brush to the apparent concentration $\phi^{\ast}$. 
Coefficients $b_0$ and $b_1$ are subject to fitting.

Consider a cylindrical particle with a center on $z$-axis embedded in a polymer brush. If one can neglect gradient in polymer density inside the brush on the length scale of the order of the particle size, $d\cdot \vert \nabla\phi(z,r) \vert \ll \phi(z)$, then the insertion free energy (with the reference state of the particle outside the brush) can be approximated as

\begin{equation}
	\begin{aligned}
		\Delta F(z_c)= &\Delta F_{osm}(z_c) + \Delta F_{surf}(z_c)=
		\\
		&\Pi(z_c)\cdot V + \gamma\{\phi(z_c)\}\cdot A
	\end{aligned}
	\label{F_ins_1}
\end{equation}
where $z_c$ is the coordinate of the center.

A more rigorous expression for the insertion free energy we use in numerical calculation for the cylindrical and spherical particles.
Insertion free energy for cylindrical particle particle co-axial to the pore's main axis are formulated as

\begin{align}
    \label{eq:cylinder_osm_fe}
    \Delta F_{osm}(z_c) =& 
    2 \pi \int_{z_c-d/2}^{z_c+d/2} \int_{0}^{d/2} \Pi(z,r) r dr dz
    \\
    \label{eq:cylinder_sur_fe}
    \Delta F_{sur}(z_c) = & 
    \\
    \nonumber
    \pi &\int_{0}^{d/2} \left[\gamma(z_c-d/2, r) + \gamma(z_c+d/2,r)\right] dr +
    \\
    \nonumber
    2 &\pi d \int_{z_c-d/2}^{z_c+d/2} \gamma(z,d/2) dz 
\end{align}

In the Eq.\ref{eq:cylinder_sur_fe} the first term integrates surface tension coefficient over cylindrical particle base, in the second it is integrated over the element of the cylinder.

The expressions for integration over spherical particle volume and surface are less trivial.
Consider spherical particle placed with an offset to the pore's main axis with coordinates in cylindrical coordinates $(z_c, r_c)$.
To formulate the simplest expression one has to integrate using local spherical coordinates with an origin placed in the spherical particle center with the zenith axis coaxial to $z$-axis.

Consider a point with a local spherical coordinates $(\rho, \theta_{pol}, \phi_{az})$, where $\rho, \theta_{pol}, \phi_{az}$ are radial, polar and azimuthal coordinate, respectively.
To translate it to global cylindrical coordinates one apply the next transformation 
\begin{align}
    &z=z_c + \rho \cos \theta_{pol}
    \\
    &r=\sqrt{r_c^2 + \rho^2 \sin^2 \theta_{pol} - 2 r_c \rho \sin \theta_{pol} \cos \phi_{az}}
\end{align} 

To calculate the osmotic term in the insertion free energy, one has to integrate osmotic pressure over the particle volume.

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:sphere_osm_fe}
    \begin{aligned}
        \Delta F_{osm}(z_c, r_c) =&
        \\ 
        2 \int_{0}^{d/2} \int_{0}^{\pi} \int_{0}^{\pi} \Pi \left\{ z_c + \rho \cos \theta_{pol}, \sqrt{r_c^2 + \rho^2 \sin^2 \theta_{pol} - 2 r_c \rho \sin \theta_{pol} \cos \phi_{az}} \right\}
        \\
        \rho^2 \sin\theta_{pol} d\theta_{pol} d\phi_{az} d\rho&
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}

To calculate the osmotic term in the insertion free energy, one has to integrate osmotic pressure over the particle volume.

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:sphere_sur_fe}
    \begin{aligned}
    \Delta F_{sur}(z_c, r_c) =&
    \\
    \frac{d^2}{2} \int_{0}^{\pi} \int_{0}^{\pi} \gamma \left\{ z_c + \rho \cos \theta_{pol}, \sqrt{r_c^2 + \frac{d^2}{4} \sin^2 \theta_{pol} - 2 r_c \frac{d}{2} \sin \theta_{pol}} \right\} &
    \\
    \sin \theta_{pol} d\theta_{pol} d\phi_{az}&
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}

Note that in Eq. \ref{eq:sphere_osm_fe}, \ref{eq:sphere_osm_fe}  $\theta_{pol}, \phi_{az}$ are dummy variables and will not present in the final result, so the insertion free energy for a given particle depends only on its position $(z_c, r_c)$.

\subsubsection*{Numerical method. Fitting procedure}
As follows from \todo{eq.} to construct analytical scheme one has to define coefficient $b_0$ and $b_1$.
This was done by a procedure where the result of insertion free energy from analytical method were mapped to the results of a probe particle insertion calculated with Scheutjens-Fleer self-consistent field (SF-SCF) numerical method.

Similar to the procedure the authors employed in \todo{ref}.
In SF-SCF scheme colloid particles defined as lattice cells impermeable for a polymer with some surface affinity to the polymer. 
The particles were moved from bulk solution to the center of the pore, by defining impermeable for the polymer lattice cells.
Not to break axial symmetry of the cylindrical pore, we consider cylindrical particle embedded in the polymer brush coaxial with the system's main axis.

Particle position is controlled by the center of the cylinder $z_c$, where $z=0$ corresponds to a cylindrical particle placed in the pore center.
For each particle position there certain value of total free energy $F_{SF}(z_c)$ calculated with SF-SCF scheme. These values were ground state corrected such that the system total free energy of a particle in bulk solution equal to zero $F_{SF}(z_c \gg 0) = 0$.

For fixed pore radius $r$, membrane thickness $s$, polymer grafting density $\sigma$ and polymerization degree $N$ insertion free energy along $z$ were explored for different values of interaction parameters $\chi_{PC}$, $\chi_{PS}$ and particle size $d$.
Polymer-colloid interaction parameter $\chi_{PC}$ ranged from -1.5 (attractive colloid particle) to 0.0 (inert colloid particle).
Polymer-solvent interaction parameter $\chi_{PS}$ ranged from 0.0 (good solvent) to 1.0 (poor solvent).
Cylindrical particles with equal diameter $d$ and height were explored for size ranging from 4 to 24 unit lengths.

    \includegraphics[width = 4in]{fig/fe_scf_grid.png}

    \caption{
        Apparent local polymer density correction factor $\phi^{\ast}/\phi$ as a function of polymer-colloid interaction parameter $\chi_{PC}$ (particle affinity to polymer).
        The value $\chi_{PC}^{\ast} \approx -1.0$ is value when no correction needed. 
        For the less attractive particles $\chi_{PC}<\chi_{PC}^{\ast}$, apparent concentration is lower then calculated with SF-SCF scheme for the empty brush $\phi^{\ast}/\phi<1$ and vice versa
        }
    \label{fig:phi_correction}
\end{figure}

To exclude any effects caused by perturbation in polymer brush when embedding larger particles the fit were performed for the smallest particles with $d=4$ moving along the main axis of the pore with radius $r_{pore} = 26$ and membrane thickness $s=26$ for a ranging values of interaction parameters $\chi_{PC}$ and $\chi_{PS}$, the other results verified and exposed limitation of the fit.

The result of the mapping is presented on the Figure \ref{fig:fe_scf_grid} for a larger particle $d=8$ then the fit had been performed for, this verifies that the analytical method is invariant of the particle size $d$.
The fit will fail, eventually, when the size $d$ became comparable with the pore diameter or in the case of extreme $\chi_{ads}$ values.

The main result of the fit is coefficients $b_0$ and $b_1$ introduced in \todo{eq}.
The coefficients were employed to calculate surface term of the insertion free energy with a correction in proximal to the particle polymer density (apparent density) $\phi^{\ast}$.
The correction is illustrated with the Figure \ref{fig:phi_correction}.

Diffusion of colloid particle in the presence of potential field governed by Smoluchowski equation. The equation is closely connected to advection-diffusion and drift-diffusion equation.

\begin{equation}
    \partial_{t} c(r,z,t) = \nabla \cdot D(r,z)(\nabla c(r, z, t) +  c(r, z, t) \nabla U)
\end{equation}

Here $c$ is the concentration of the colloidal particles, $D$ is the local diffusion coefficient, and $U \equiv \Delta F$ is the position-dependent free energy of insertion which plays the role of the potential of mean force.


Consider an element of the regular grid with a constant volume $V(i,k)$ and surface area $S(i,k)$.
The change in the concentration in the element is defined by the net flux of colloid particle through the element surface which can be expressed using divergence theorem.

\subsection{Numerical methods. Discretization scheme.}
Polymer brush density profiles and insertion free energy profiles is a main ingredient to study the transport through the pore.  
Scheutjens-Fleer SCF numerical method was employed to study polymer brush density profiles and a probe particle insertion free energy profiles.
The method based on free energy functional minimization, the result is discrete density profile with minimum system free energy.

This method make use of discrete space coordinates, as the system exhibit axial symmetry, the space is discretized into homogeneously curved two gradient lattices \emph{i. e.} cylindrical lattice.

There are two coordinate axes: longitudinal $z$ and radial $r$ (Figure \ref{fig:main_discretization}(1,2)). 
Gradient in longitudinal direction produces planar lattice layers, gradient in radial direction produces curved coaxial cylindrical walls.

While $rz$ coordinate system looks identical to the two dimensional Cartesian coordinates on the figures, each element of the lattice is square toroid (Figure \ref{fig:main_discretization}(5)), the mean-field approximation is applied in angular direction, means properties in angular direction are uniform.
For the two dimensional Cartesian coordinates each element is square box with an infinite height.

    The space is discretized using regular 2D grid (4) with element size $\delta z = \delta r = a$, where $a$ is Kuhn segment length.

Ideally, to extract ground state one has place a particle infinitely far from the membrane, in practice the particle has to placed far enough from the membrane.
Obviously, semi-infinite reservoirs can not be calculated with lattice method explicitly, one has to find some adequate system lattice size when any increase in lattice size does not translates to the better precision.

The geometrical features of the simulation volume is illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:sim_box_layout}. 
There are additional number of layers $l_1$ and $l_2$ in longitudinal direction to model two semi-infinite reservoirs, the number of layers selected such that in the good solvent when the brush is the most swollen one could place colloid particle without any contact with the polymer.
Number of layers in radial direction beyond the pore $h$ were chosen such that the swollen brush can not extend to the simulation volume edge.

\subsubsection{Insertion free energy for cylindrical particle}

To build and verified analytical insertion free energy scheme cylindrical particle insertion were analyzed with SF-SCF numeric scheme.

Insertion free energy were calculated analytically for a cylindrical particle and compared with the results of SF-SCF.
Consider cylindrical particle with diameter and height $d$, to calculate osmotic term (\todo{eq}) one has to integrate osmotic pressure profile over particle volume.
To calculate the integral numerically, a particle discretized spatially into the volume elements, using cylindrical lattice constructed in SF-SCF scheme.
%The discretization were done such that the particle shares the the same volume elements as the ones used in SF-SCF scheme.
Thus, lattice element either fully occupied by the particle or not.
The volume of discretization elements schematically shown on Figure \ref{fig:cylindrical_kernel} on vertical cross-section plane.
Suppose the particle has coordinate of the center ${(0, z_c)}$, the particle is divided into $d^2/2$ elements, $d$ - horizontally and $d/2$ - vertically, the volume of each element forms a matrix $v[d \times d/2]$.
\begin{equation}
    v[k,i] = \pi(2i+1)
\end{equation}
where $v[k,i]$ is $i$-th element volume.
The sum of $v$ is equal to cylindrical particle volume.
\begin{equation}
    \sum_{i=0}^{d/2-1} \sum_{k=0}^{d-1} v[k,i] = \frac{\pi d^3}{4}
\end{equation}

To calculate osmotic term in insertion free energy one has to find the next dot product for the each position of $z$.
\begin{equation}
    \Delta F_{osm}[z_c] = \sum_{i=0}^{d/2-1} \sum_{k=0}^{d-1} v[k,i] \cdot \Pi[z_c-d/2+k, i]
\end{equation}


The surface term is calculated similar to the osmotic term, but rather than volume one found surface of the discretization element. 
Obviously, inner part of the particle has no surface, which is illustrated in the horizontal cutaway surface in Figure \ref{fig:cylindrical_kernel}.
The surface of each discretization element forms a matrix $s[d \times d/2]$, such that only outer layer has non-zero values.

\begin{eqnarray}
    s_{element}[i,k] = 
    \begin{cases}
        2 \pi i,   & \text{if}\ i=d/2-1 \\
        0,         & \text{otherwise}
    \end{cases}
    \\
    s_{base}[i,k] = 
    \begin{cases}
        2\pi(i+1), & \text{if}\ k=0 \text{ or } k=d-1 \\
        0,         & \text{otherwise}
    \end{cases}
    \\
    s[i,k] = s_{element}[i,k] + s_{base}[i,k]
\end{eqnarray}
where $s_{element}$ - element surface if the element contains \emph{element} of the cylinder,
$s_{base}$ - element surface if the element contains \emph{base} of the cylinder.

The sum of $s$ is equal to cylindrical particle surface
\begin{equation}
    \sum_{i=0}^{d/2-1} \sum_{k=0}^{d-1} s[k,i] = \frac{3 \pi d^2}{2}
\end{equation}

To calculate surface term in insertion free energy one has to find the next dot product for the each position of $z$.
\begin{equation}
    \Delta F_{sur}[z_c] = \sum_{i=0}^{d/2-1} \sum_{k=0}^{d-1} s[k,i] \cdot \gamma[z_c-d/2+k, i]
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Insertion free energy for spherical particle}
To calculate osmotic term of the particle insertion free energy osmotic pressure is summed over the all elements occupied by the particle weighted by the occupancy. 

\todo{It is a convolution operation ($\ast$) only in some sence, since v[l, m] and s[l,m] will change with the particle offset, they are rather 3d matrices $m[i,i,k]$.
This would be a true convolution for Cartesian lattice.}
\begin{align}
    &F_{osm}[r_c, z_c] = \sum_{i=z_c-d/2}^{z_c+d/2-1} \sum_{k=\max\{r_c-d/2, 0\}}^{r_c+d/2-1} \Pi[k,i] \cdot v[k,i] = \Pi \ast v
    \\
    &F_{sur}[r_c, z_c] = \sum_{i=z_c-d/2}^{z_c+d/2-1} \sum_{k=\max\{r_c-d/2, 0\}}^{r_c+d/2-1} \gamma[k,i] \cdot s[k,i] = \gamma \ast s
\end{align}
where $r_c, z_c$ is the particle's center position, square brackets denotes discrete nature of the function.
The summation limit ${k=\max\{r_c-d/2, 0\}}$ depends on the offset from $z$-axis.


The sum of $v$ and $s$ is equal to spherical particle volume and surface, respectively.
\begin{eqnarray}
    \sum_{i,k} v[k,i] = \frac{\pi d^{3}}{6}
    \\
    \sum_{i,k} s[k,i] = \pi d^{2}
