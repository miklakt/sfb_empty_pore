\section{Linking local resistivity to global transport}

% Having defined the position-dependent insertion free energy and colloid diffusivity, we can develop an analytical method to estimate the total resistance of the brush-filled pore to the diffusive flow of colloids.

Diffusive transport in the presence of an external force generated by the insertion free energy $\Delta F$ in a position-dependent diffusion coefficient is described by the Smoluchowski equation,
\begin{equation}
    \frac{\partial c(\bm{r})}{\partial t}=-\nabla \cdot \Bigl(D(\bm{r}) \Bigl[\nabla c({\bm{r}})+c({\bm{r}})\nabla\bigl(\Delta F(\bm{r})\bigr)\Bigr]\Bigr),
    \label{eq:Smoluch}
\end{equation}

The next function transformation defined:
\begin{eqnarray}
    \begin{gathered}
        \tilde{c}(\bm{r}) = c(\bm{r})\exp(\Delta F(\bm{r}))
        \\
        \tilde{D}(\bm{r}) = D(\bm{r})\exp(-\Delta F(\bm{r})) 
    \end{gathered}
    \label{eq:transform}
\end{eqnarray}
where $\tilde{c}(\bm{r})$ and $\tilde{D}(\bm{r})$ are modified colloid concentration and modified position-dependent diffusion coefficient, respectively.

In our case the boundary conditions for the modified concentration are $\tilde{c}(z\rightarrow -\infty)=\Delta c$ and $\tilde{c}(z\rightarrow +\infty)=0$ since the insertion free energy $\Delta F$ vanishes far away from the pore.

With the defined transformations Eq.~\ref{eq:transform} and boundary conditions, modified concentration is divergence free $\nabla \tilde{c}(\bm{r}) = 0$ and the Smoluchowski equation (Eq.~(\ref{eq:Smoluch})) have a from of generalized Laplace equation.
\begin{eqnarray}
    \begin{gathered}
        \mathcal{L} \tilde{c} = 0\\
        \text{where} \quad \mathcal{L}  = \nabla \tilde{D}(\bm{r}) \nabla 
    \end{gathered}
    \label{eq:laplace}
\end{eqnarray}
With the flux density tracking the Fickian form:
\begin{eqnarray}
    \begin{gathered}
        \bm{j}(\bm{r}) = \mathcal{J} \tilde{c}(\bm{r})\\
        \text{where} \quad \mathcal{J}  = \tilde{D}(\bm{r}) \nabla 
    \end{gathered}
\end{eqnarray}

At the central crossection of the pore $z=0$, the flux density has only axial component to it $j=j_z$, thus the total flux through the pore is found by integrating flux density over the central crossection:
\begin{eqnarray}
    %\tilde{D}(r',z=0)\frac{\partial \tilde{c}(r',z=0)}
    J = 2\pi\int_{0}^{r_p}j(r',z=0) r' \text{d}r'
\end{eqnarray}

We select large enough finite domain  $r,z \in [0, r_{\text{max}}] \times [z_{\text{min}}, z_{\text{max}}]$, with the pore orientated along $z$-axis with the pore center at the origin.
In the discretized domain the continuous space is discretized to a cylindrical regular lattice with $\Delta z = \Delta r = 1$ with $N_r$ points in radial direction and $N_z$ points in axial direction $N_r \times N_z$, indexed with $i \in [0, N_r]$ and $k \in [0, N_z]$ respectively.
such that $r_i = i$ and $z_k =  z_{\text{min}} + k$.

We set the boundary conditions Dirichlet boundary conditions at the edges of axial coordinates $\tilde{c}_{i,k=0} = c_0$ and $\tilde{c}_{i,k=N_z-1} = 0$, and Neumann (reflective) boundary condition at the edge of radial coordinates $\tilde{c}_{i=N_r-1,k} = \tilde{c}_{i=N_r-2,k}$.

In the discrete domain the Smoluchowski diffusion operator $\mathcal{L}$ takes a sparse matrix form $\mathbf{L}_{m,m}$ with dimensions $[N_r N_z \times N_r N_z]$, reindexed as $m = k N_r + i$., the Eq.~(\ref{eq:laplace}) is rewriten in the matrix form as system of linear equations:
\begin{eqnarray}
    \mathbf{L} \tilde{\bm{C}} = \bm{b}
    \label{eq:matrix_form}
\end{eqnarray}
where the discrete values of modified concentration $\tilde{c}_{i,k}$ flatten to vector $\tilde{C}_m$ with the dimension $[N_r N_z]$, reindexed as $m = k N_r + i$.
The boundary conditions are reflected in vector $b$, and operator matrix $\mathbf{L}$ (see Supplementary Method).

From the solution $\tilde{C}_m$ we recover discrete modified concentration reshaped $\tilde{c}_{i,k}$ and physical concentration $\tilde{c}_{i,k} \exp{-\Delta F_{i,k}}$.

\begin{eqnarray}
    J \approx 2 \pi \sum_{i=0}^{N_r} \tilde{D}_{i, 0} \frac{\tilde{c}_{i, 1} - \tilde{c}_{i, 0}}{\Delta z} 
\end{eqnarray}

\begin{eqnarray}
    R_{\text{int}} = 2 \pi \int\limits_{-L/2}^{L/2} \Bigg[\int_{0}^{r_p} \tilde{D}(r',z') r' \text{d}r' \Bigg]^{-1} \text{d}z'
    \\
    R_{\text{ext}} = \Delta c/J - R_{\text{int}}
\end{eqnarray}
