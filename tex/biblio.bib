In polymer solutions the viscosity of nanoprobes of size R approaches the macroscopic viscosity when R exceeds the radius of gyration of the polymer, Rg. The nano to macroviscosity crossover occurs for R ~ Rg. Here we analyze diffusion in a polymer (polyethylene glycol) solution of nanoparticles in the crossover regime. We report a scale dependent diffusion coefficient in this regime due to non-uniform viscosity in the depletion layer around particles. The phenomenological scaling of the slow diffusion coefficient as a function of probe size is compared to the same scaling for macroscopic viscosity as a function of polymer size.},

@article{Tu2011,
  abstract  = {Molecular traffic between the cytoplasm and the nucleoplasm of eukaryotic cells is mediated by nuclear pore complexes (NPCs). Hundreds, if not thousands, of molecules interact with and transit through each NPC every second. The pore is blocked by a permeability barrier, which consists of a network of intrinsically unfolded polypeptides containing thousands of phenylalanine-glycine (FG) repeat motifs. This FG-network rejects larger molecules and admits smaller molecules or cargos bound to nuclear transport receptors (NTRs). For a cargo transport complex, minimally consisting of a cargo molecule plus an NTR, access to the permeability barrier is provided by interactions between the NTR and the FG repeat motifs. Numerous models have been postulated to explain the controlled accessibility and the transport characteristics of the FG-network, but the amorphous, flexible nature of this structure has hindered characterization. A relatively recent development is the ability to monitor the real-time movement of single molecules through individual NPCs via single molecule fluorescence (SMF) microscopy. A major advantage of this approach is that it can be used to continuously monitor a series of specific molecular interactions in an active pore with millisecond time resolution, which therefore allows one to distinguish between kinetic and thermodynamic control. Novel insights and prospects for the future are outlined in this review.

The method takes into account the effect of short-range interactions in polymer chains, in particular, the chain stiffness and secondary structure. The theory of adsorption of chains of different stiffness is developed, and the process of adsorption which occurs when the external conditions change is shown to be always a second-order phase transition. The critical adsorption energy decreases and the sharpness of transition grows when the chain stiffness increases. A simple model of a chain with "virtual" steps is proposed which simplifies the treatment; the results obtained are in good agreement with exact theories. A general scheme of analysis of adsorption of chains with a given secondary structure is set forth and the analogy between the stiffness of a noncooperative chain and the presence of helical segments in a polypeptide chain is discussed.

Both ideal noninteracting chains and chains with excluded volume interactions are treated. Polymer linear dimensions parallel and perpendicular to the wall and their probability distributions are studied, as well as the behavior of the monomer fraction at the surface and a distance z in the interior. The relation of polymer statistics to the problem of correlation functions in the n-vector model of magnetism in the limit n->0 is exploited to express both the exponents describing the various power laws and the crossover scaling functions near Ta in terms of results for the analogous problem of the critical behavior of magnets with a free surface. The predictions of this scaling theory are confirmed by Monte Carlo studies of self-avoiding walks on the tetrahedral lattice with a free surface, and estimates for the exponents involved are presented.

  abstract = {Abstract Experimental measurements of effective diffusive permeabilities and effective diffusion coefficients in biofilms are reviewed. Effective diffusive permeabilities, the parameter appropriate to the analysis of reaction-diffusion interactions, depend on solute type and biofilm density. Three categories of solute physical chemistry with distinct diffusive properties were distinguished by the present analysis. In order of descending mean relative effective diffusive permeability (De/Daq) these were inorganic anions or cations (0.56), nonpolar solutes with molecular weights of 44 or less (0.43), and organic solutes of molecular weight greater than 44 (0.29). Effective diffusive permeabilities decrease sharply with increasing biomass volume fraction suggesting a serial resistance model of diffusion in biofilms as proposed by Hinson and Kocher (1996). A conceptual model of biofilm structure is proposed in which each cell is surrounded by a restricted permeability envelope. Effective diffusion coefficients, which are appropriate to the analysis of transient penetration of nonreactive solutes, are generally similar to effective diffusive permeabilities in biofilms of similar composition. In three studies that examine diffusion of very large molecular weight solutes ( > 5000) in biofilms, the average ratio of the relative effective diffusion coefficient of the large solute to the relative effective diffusion coefficient of either sucrose or fluorescein was 0.64, 0.61, and 0.36. It is proposed that large solutes are effectively excluded from microbial cells, that small solutes partition into and diffuse within cells, and that ionic solutes are excluded from cells but exhibit increased diffusive permeability (but decreased effective diffusion coefficients) due to sorption to the biofilm matrix.

The architecture and dynamics of the FG-network have been refractory to characterization due to the paucity of experimental methods able to probe the mobility and density of the FG-polypeptides and embedded macromolecules within intact NPCs. Combining fluorescence polarization, super-resolution microscopy, and mathematical analyses, we examined the rotational mobility of fluorescent probes at various locations within the FG-network under different conditions. We demonstrate that polarization PALM (p-PALM) provides a rich source of information about low rotational mobilities that are inaccessible with bulk fluorescence anisotropy approaches, and anticipate that p-PALM is well-suited to explore numerous crowded cellular environments. In total, our findings indicate that the NPC's internal organization consists of multiple dynamic environments with different local properties.},

  abstract  = {Conformational behavior of intrinsically disordered proteins, such as Phe-Gly repeat domains, alters drastically when they are confined in and tethered to, nan channels. This has challenged our understanding of how they serve to selectively facilitate translocation of nuclear transport receptor (NTR)-bearing macromolecules. Heterogeneous FG-repeats, tethered to the NPC interior, nonuniformly fill the channel in a diameter-dependent manner and adopt a rapid Brownian motion, thereby forming a porous and highly dynamic polymeric meshwork that percolates in radial and axial directions and features two distinguishable zones: a dense hydrophobic rod-like zone located in the center and a peripheral low-density shell-like zone. The FG-meshwork is locally disrupted upon interacting with NTR-bearing macromolecules, but immediately reconstructs itself between 0.44 mcs and 7.0 mcs, depending on cargo size and shape. This confers a perpetually-sealed state to the NPC and is solely due to rapid Brownian motion of FG-repeats, not FG-repeat hydrophobic bonds. Elongated-shaped macromolecules, both in the presence and absence of NTRs, penetrate more readily into the FG-meshwork compared to their globular counterparts of identical volume and surface chemistry, highlighting the importance of the shape effects in nucleocytoplasmic transport. These results can help our understanding of geometrical effects in and the design of, intelligent and responsive biopolymer-based materials in nanofiltration and artificial nanopores.},

  abstract  = {Nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) form a selective filter that allows the rapid passage of transport factors (TFs) and their cargoes across the nuclear envelope, while blocking the passage of other macromolecules. Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) containing phenylalanyl-glycyl (FG)-rich repeats line the pore and interact with TFs. However, the reason that transport can be both fast and specific remains undetermined, through lack of atomic-scale information on the behavior of FGs and their interaction with TFs. We used nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy to address these issues. We show that FG repeats are highly dynamic IDPs, stabilized by the cellular environment. Fast transport of TFs is supported because the rapid motion of FG motifs allows them to exchange on and off TFs extremely quickly through transient interactions. Because TFs uniquely carry multiple pockets for FG repeats, only they can form the many frequent interactions needed for specific passage between FG repeats to cross the NPC.},

  abstract  = {The mechanisms by which intrinsically disordered proteins engage in rapid and highly selective binding is a subject of considerable interest and represents a central paradigm to nuclear pore complex (NPC) function, where nuclear transport receptors (NTRs) move through the NPC by binding disordered phenylalanine-glycine-rich nucleoporins (FG-Nups). Combining single-molecule fluorescence, molecular simulations, and nuclear magnetic resonance, we show that a rapidly fluctuating FG-Nup populates an ensemble of conformations that are prone to bind NTRs with near diffusion-limited on rates, as shown by stopped-flow kinetic measurements. This is achieved using multiple, minimalistic, low-affinity binding motifs that are in rapid exchange when engaging with the NTR, allowing the FG-Nup to maintain an unexpectedly high plasticity in its bound state. We propose that these exceptional physical characteristics enable a rapid and specific transport mechanism in the physiological context, a notion supported by single molecule in-cell assays on intact NPCs.},

  abstract  = {Creating a selective gel that filters particles based on their interactions is a major goal of nanotechnology, with far-reaching implications from drug delivery to controlling assembly pathways. However, this is particularly difficult when the particles are larger than the gel's characteristic mesh size because such particles cannot passively pass through the gel. Thus, filtering requires the interacting particles to transiently reorganize the gel's internal structure. While significant advances, e.g., in DNA engineering, have enabled the design of nano-materials with programmable interactions, it is not clear what physical principles such a designer gel could exploit to achieve selective permeability. We present an equilibrium mechanism where crosslink binding dynamics are affected by interacting particles such that particle diffusion is enhanced. In addition to revealing specific design rules for manufacturing selective gels, our results have the potential to explain the origin of selective permeability in certain biological materials, including the nuclear pore complex. Gels filtering particles by interactions are a goal of nanotechnology; this is difficult when particles are larger than the mesh of the gel. Here, the authors present an equilibrium mechanism where binding dynamics of crosslinks are affected by interacting particles so that particles experience enhanced diffusion.},

  abstract  = {Nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) mediate bidirectional transport of proteins, RNAs, and ribonucleoprotein complexes across the double-membrane nuclear envelope. In vitro studies with purified transport cofactors have revealed a general scheme of cofactor-dependent transport energetically driven by the G protein Ran. However, the size and complexity of NPCs have made it difficult to clearly define the loci and kinetics of the cofactor-NPC interactions required for transport. We now report the use of single-molecule fluorescence microscopy to directly monitor a model protein substrate undergoing transport through NPCs in permeabilized cells. This substrate, NLS-2xGFP, interacts with NPCs for an average of $10 \pm 1$ ms during transport. However, because the maximum nuclear accumulation rate of NLS-2xGFP was measured to be at least $\approx 10^3$ molecules per NPC per s, NPCs must be capable of transporting at least $\approx 10$ substrate molecules simultaneously. Molecular tracking reveals that substrate molecules spend most of their transit time randomly moving in the central pore of the NPC and that the rate-limiting step is escape from the central pore.},

  abstract     = {Nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) lined with intrinsically disordered FG-domains act as selective gatekeepers for molecular transport between the nucleus and the cytoplasm in eukaryotic cells. The underlying physical mechanism of the intriguing selectivity is still under debate. Here, we probe the transport of ions and transport receptors through biomimetic NPCs consisting of Nsp1 domains attached to the inner surface of solid-state nanopores. We examine both wildtype FG-domains and hydrophilic SG-mutants. FG-nanopores showed a clear selectivity as transport receptors can translocate across the pore whereas other proteins cannot. SG mutant pores lack such selectivity. To unravel this striking difference, we present coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations that reveal that FG-pores exhibit a high-density, nonuniform protein distribution, in contrast to a uniform and significantly less-dense protein distribution in the SG-mutant. We conclude that the sequence-dependent density distribution of disordered proteins inside the NPC plays a key role for its conductivity and selective permeability.},

This nucleo-cytoplasmic transport of macromolecules is critical for both cell physiology and pathology. Consequently, investigating its regulation and disease-associated alterations can reveal novel therapeutic approaches to fight human diseases, such as cancer or viral infection. The characterization of the nuclear pore complex, the identification of transport signals and transport receptors, as well as the characterization of the Ran system (providing the energy source for efficient cargo transport) has greatly facilitated our understanding of the components, mechanisms and regulation of the nucleo-cytoplasmic transport of proteins in our cells.

  abstract  = {In eukaryotic cells, transport of molecules between the nucleus and the cytoplasm is facilitated by highly selective and efficient biomachines known as nuclear pore complexes (NPCs). The structural details of NPCs vary across species, with many of their constituent proteins exhibiting relatively low sequence conservation; yet the NPC as a whole retains its general architecture and mechanism of action in all eukaryotes from yeast to humans. This functional conservation in the absence of precise molecular conservation suggests that many aspects of the NPC transport mechanism may be understood based on general biophysical considerations. Accordingly, some aspects of NPC function have been recapitulated in artificial nanochannel mimics, even though they lack certain molecular elements of the endogenous NPC. Herein, we review biophysical aspects of NPC architecture and function and cover recent progress in the field. We also review recent advances in man-made molecular filters inspired by NPCs, and their applications in nanotechnology. We conclude the review with an outlook on outstanding questions in the field and biomedical aspects of NPC transport.}

  abstract  = {Nuclear pore complexes play central roles as gatekeepers of RNA and protein transport between the cytoplasm and nucleoplasm. However, their large size and dynamic nature have impeded a full structural and functional elucidation. Here we determined the structure of the entire 552-protein nuclear pore complex of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae at sub-nanometre precision by satisfying a wide range of data relating to the molecular arrangement of its constituents. The nuclear pore complex incorporates sturdy diagonal columns and connector cables attached to these columns, imbuing the structure with strength and flexibility. These cables also tie together all other elements of the nuclear pore complex, including membrane-interacting regions, outer rings and RNA-processing platforms. Inwardly directed anchors create a high density of transport factor-docking Phe-Gly repeats in the central channel, organized into distinct functional units. This integrative structure enables us to rationalize the architecture, transport mechanism and evolutionary origins of the nuclear pore complex. The structure of the yeast nuclear pore complex, determined at sub-nanometre precision using an integrative approach that combines a wide range of data, reveals details of its architecture, transport mechanism and evolutionary origins. Nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) are the gateways for the transport of RNA and proteins into and out of the nucleus. Although previous work has provided structural insights into parts of NPCs, getting a full picture of these complexes has proved difficult owing to their large size and dynamic nature. A multidisciplinary team of researchers now report the structure of the entire 552-protein NPC of the yeast at a sub-nanometre level using an integrative approach including mass spectrometry, cryo-electron tomography and chemical crosslinking. The structure provides a detailed view of the functional elements of the NPC and clarifies its architecture, mechanism of action and evolutionary origins.},

  abstract  = {The nuclear pore complex (NPC) is a macromolecular assembly embedded within the nuclear envelope that mediates bidirectional exchange of material between the nucleus and cytoplasm. Our recent work on the yeast NPC has revealed a simple modularity in its architecture and suggested a common evolutionary origin of the NPC and vesicle coating complexes in a progenitor protocoatomer. However, detailed compositional and structural information is currently only available for vertebrate and yeast NPCs, which are evolutionarily closely related. Hence our understanding of NPC composition in a full evolutionary context is sparse. Moreover despite the ubiquitous nature of the NPC, sequence searches in distant taxa have identified surprisingly few NPC components, suggesting that much of the NPC may not be conserved. Thus, to gain a broad perspective on the origins and evolution of the NPC, we performed proteomics analyses of NPC-containing fractions from a divergent eukaryote (Trypanosoma brucei) and obtained a comprehensive inventory of its nucleoporins. Strikingly trypanosome nucleoporins clearly share with metazoa and yeast their fold type, domain organization, composition, and modularity. Overall these data provide conclusive evidence that the majority of NPC architecture is indeed conserved throughout the Eukaryota and was already established in the last common eukaryotic ancestor. These findings strongly support the hypothesis that NPCs share a common ancestry with vesicle coating complexes and that both were established very early in eukaryotic evolution.

In this study, we developed an integrated targeted proteomics and super-resolution microscopy approach to determine the absolute stoichiometry of the human nuclear pore complex (NPC), possibly the largest eukaryotic protein complex. We show that the human NPC has a previously unanticipated stoichiometry that varies across cancer cell types, tissues and in disease. Using large-scale proteomics, we provide evidence that more than one third of the known, well-defined nuclear protein complexes display a similar cell type-specific variation of their subunit stoichiometry. Our data point to compositional rearrangement as a widespread mechanism for adapting the functions of molecular machines toward cell type-specific constraints and context-dependent needs, and highlight the need of deeper investigation of such structural variants.},

  abstract  = {Translocation through the nuclear pore complex (NPC), a large transporter spanning the nuclear envelope, is a passive, diffusion-driven process, paradoxically enhanced by binding. To account for this mystery, several models have been suggested. However, recent experiments with modified NPCs make reconsideration necessary. Here, we suggest that nuclear transport receptors (NTRs) such as the karyopherins, in accordance with their peculiar boat-like structure, act as nanoscopic ferries transporting cargos through the NPC by sliding on surface of phenylalanine glycine (FG) motifs. The dense array of FG motifs that covers the cytoplasmic filaments of the NPC is thought to continue on the wall of the large channel permeating the central framework of the NPC and on parts of the nuclear filaments to yield a coherent FG surface. Nuclear transport receptors are assumed to bind to the FG surface at filaments or at the channel entrance and then to rapidly search the FG surface by a two-dimensional random walk for the channel exit where they are released. The passage of neutral molecules is restricted to a narrow tube in the center of the central channel by a loose network of peptide chains. The model features virtual gating, is compatible with but not dependent on FG affinity gradients and tolerates deletions and transpositions of FG motifs. Implications of the model are discussed and tests are suggested. Copyright (c) Blackwell Munksgaard 2005.},

@article{Tijana2008,
  abstract  = {Nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) are the gateways between a cell's nucleus and its cytoplasm and allow only selected macromolecules to cross the nuclear envelope. Based on an elucidation of the architecture and mechanism of this complex, Jovanovic-Talisman et al. have designed and produced an artificial nanopore membrane that mimics its selectivity. The membrane features the two vital elements of the natural complex - a simple passageway and a lining of proteins, phenylalanine-glycine nucleoporins, familiarly known as 'FG-nups'. As in the natural complex, the artificial nanopores allow only transport factors and transport-factor-carrying cargoes that specifically bind to FG-nups, to pass. This work opens the way to an array of nature-inspired nanodevices that can detect and sort molecules of medical and industrial significance. Nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) serve as gateways between the nucleus and cytoplasm and allow only the transport of selected macromolecules across the nuclear envelope. NPCs are comprised of a scaffold that anchors proteins called FG-nucleoporins, which contain disordered regions that line the inner surface of the pore and extend into the lumen. This study reports the design of an artificial membrane that functions as a selective filter in allowing efficient passage of transport factors and transport factor carrying cargo that specifically bind to FG-nucleoporins. Nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) act as effective and robust gateways between the nucleus and the cytoplasm, selecting for the passage of particular macromolecules across the nuclear envelope. NPCs comprise an elaborate scaffold that defines a ~30 nm diameter passageway connecting the nucleus and the cytoplasm. This scaffold anchors proteins termed 'phenylalanine-glycine' (FG)-nucleoporins, the natively disordered domains of which line the passageway and extend into its lumen1. Passive diffusion through this lined passageway is hindered in a size-dependent manner. However, transport factors and their cargo-bound complexes overcome this restriction by transient binding to the FG-nucleoporins2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10. To test whether a simple passageway and a lining of transport-factor-binding FG-nucleoporins are sufficient for selective transport, we designed a functionalized membrane that incorporates just these two elements. Here we demonstrate that this membrane functions as a nanoselective filter, efficiently passing transport factors and transport-factor-cargo complexes that specifically bind FG-nucleoporins, while significantly inhibiting the passage of proteins that do not. This inhibition is greatly enhanced when transport factor is present. Determinants of selectivity include the passageway diameter, the length of the nanopore region coated with FG-nucleoporins, the binding strength to FG-nucleoporins, and the antagonistic effect of transport factors on the passage of proteins that do not specifically bind FG-nucleoporins. We show that this artificial system faithfully reproduces key features of trafficking through the NPC, including transport-factor-mediated cargo import.},

Biomimetic strategies offer new opportunities to investigate this remarkable transport phenomenon2. Here, we show selective transport of proteins across individual biomimetic nuclear pore complexes at the single-molecule level. Each biomimetic complex is constructed by covalently tethering either Nup98 or Nup153 (phenylalanine-glycine (FG) nucleoporins) to a solid-state nanopore3. Individual translocation events are monitored using ionic current measurements with sub-millisecond temporal resolution. Transport receptors (Imp$\beta$) proceed with a dwell time of ~2.5 ms for both Nup98- and Nup153-coated pores, whereas the passage of non-specific proteins is strongly inhibited with different degrees of selectivity. For pores up to ~25 nm in diameter, Nups form a dense and low-conducting barrier, whereas they adopt a more open structure in larger pores. Our biomimetic nuclear pore complex provides a quantitative platform for studying nucleocytoplasmic transport phenomena at the single-molecule level in vitro. Covalently attaching nuclear pore proteins to solid-state nanopores forms a complex that can selectively transport certain proteins, similar to the nuclear pore complex.},

In correlation-averaged CTEM pictures of negatively stained intact NPCs and of distinct NPC components (i.e., "rings," "spoke" complexes, and "plug-spoke" complexes), several fine structural features arranged with octagonal symmetry about a central axis could reproducibly be identified. STEM micrographs of unstained/freeze-dried intact NPCs as well as of their components yielded comparable but less distinct features. Mass determination by STEM revealed the following molecular masses: intact NPC with plug, 124 \pm 11 MD; intact NPC without plug, 112 \pm 11 MD; heavy ring, 32 \pm 5 MD; light ring, 21 \pm 4 MD; plug-spoke complex, 66 \pm 8 MD; and spoke complex, 52 \pm 3 MD.

We probed the passive barrier of NPCs and observed sieve-like properties with a dominating mesh or channel radius of 2.6 nm, which is narrower than proposed earlier. A small fraction of diffusion channels has a wider opening, explaining the very slow passage of larger molecules. The observed dominant passive diameter approximates the distance of adjacent hydrophobic clusters of FG repeats, supporting the model that the barrier is made of FG repeat domains cross-linked with a spacing of an FG repeat unit length. Wheat germ agglutinin and the dominant-negative importin B 45-462 fragment were previously regarded as selective inhibitors of facilitated NPC passage. We now observed that they do not distinguish between the passive and the facilitated mode. Instead, their inhibitory effect correlates with the size of the NPC-passing molecule. They have little effect on small species, inhibit the passage of green fluorescent protein-sized objects 10-fold and virtually block the translocation of larger ones. This suggests that passive and facilitated NPC passage proceed through one and the same permeability barrier. (c) 2009 European Molecular Biology Organization.},

The review is organized in two parts, starting with all-smart membranes based on intrinsically smart materials, in particular of the poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) family and similar polymers. The key steps of membrane fabrication are discussed, namely the deposition into thin films, functionalization of pores, and the secondary crosslinking of pre-existing microgel particles into membranes. The latter may be free-standing and do not necessitate the presence of a porous support layer. The temperature-dependent swelling properties of polymers provide a means of controlling the size of pores, and thus size-sensitive gating. Throughout the review, we highlight "positive" (gates open) or "negative" (closed) gating effects with respect to increasing temperature. In the second part, the functionalization of porous organic or inorganic membranes of various origins by either microgel particles or linear polymer brushes is discussed. In this case, the key steps are the adsorption or grafting mechanisms. Finally, whenever provided by the authors, the suitability of smart gating membranes for specific applications is highlighted.},

This has made the development of switchable molecular sieving responsive membranes with a self-cleaning capability possible. This chapter is dedicated to summarizing the progress of stimuli responsive membranes with reversibly switchable physicochemical properties. Here, the implementation of stimuli responsive membranes in water treatment is introduced. Structural flexibility of stimuli responsive materials is discussed to initiate the requirements of stimuli membranes. Next, types of stimuli responsive membranes and their applications as separation tools for controllable physicochemical changes in response to environmental cues are reviewed.

Further conferring membranes with stimuli responsiveness can allow them to dynamically tune their pore structure and/or surface properties for efficient separation performance. This review summarizes and discusses important developments and achievements in stimuli-responsive membranes. The most commonly utilized stimuli, including light, pH, temperature, ions, and electric and magnetic fields, are discussed in detail. Special attention is given to stimuli-responsive control of membrane pore structure (pore size and porosity/connectivity) and surface properties (wettability, surface topology, and surface charge), from the perspective of determining the appropriate membrane properties and microstructures. This review also focuses on strategies to prepare stimuli-responsive membranes, including blending, casting, polymerization, self-assembly, and electrospinning. Smart applications for separations are also reviewed as well as a discussion of remaining challenges and future prospects in this exciting field. This review offers critical insights for the membrane and broader materials science communities regarding the on-demand and dynamic control of membrane structures and properties. We hope that this review will inspire the design of novel stimuli-responsive membranes to promote sustainable development and make progress toward commercialization.},

The conformation of molecular brushes is governed by side chains separated by a distance much smaller than their unperturbed dimensions, which leads to significant monomer congestion and entropically unfavorable extension of both the backbone and side chains. Generally, conformation as well as changes in physical properties of polymers can be influenced by external stimuli, such as solvent, temperature, pH, and light. The mechanisms and driving forces for the conformational variation in response to external stimuli are unique for molecular brushes since these conformational changes can be restricted to a single molecule.

  abstract  = {A fast and simple method for the preparation of pH-sensitive hydrogel membranes for drug delivery and tissue engineering applications has been developed using carbodiimide chemistry. The hydrogels were formed by the intermolecular cross-linking of carboxymethyl dextran (CM-dextran) using 1-ethyl-(3-3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) and N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS). Infrared spectra of the hydrogels suggest the formation of ester bonds between the hydroxyl and carboxyl groups in the CM-dextran. The porosity of the hydrogels produced, as shown by protein diffusion, increases in response to changes in the pH and the ionic strength of the external medium. The results show pH-dependent swelling behaviour arising from the acidic pedant groups in the polymer network. The diffusion of the protein lysozyme through the hydrogel membranes increased with increases in both pH (5.0-9.0) and ionic strength. The effect of changes of pH and ionic strength on the hydrogel's permeability was shown to be reversible. Scanning electron microscopy of these hydrogels showed that pH-dependent changes in permeability are mirrored by morphological changes in gel structure. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract  = {Surface grafting of a polymerizable monomer onto Au was used to produce nanometer-scale planar hydrogel films with controllable volume. A self-assembled monolayer of 11-mercaptoundecanoic acid on a planar Au surface was activated through water-soluble carbodiimide and N-hyroxysuctinimide followed by reaction with 2-aminomethacrylate to produce a methacrylate-terminated surface layer, which readily polymerized under UV radiation in the presence of hydroxyethyl methacrylate monomer, ethylene glycol dimethacrylate cross-linker, and a photoinitiator. The reaction steps were characterized by external reflection mode Fourier transform IR spectroscopy. Under controlled UV exposure, thin (3 nm < d < 10 nm) hydrogel films were obtained from 1:1 ethanol/H 2O. Surface plasmon resonance measurements were used to characterize both the synthesis of the hydrogel and the potential-induced volume changes. The nanometer-scale hydrogels thus produced undergo reproducible changes in thickness, when a potential is applied across the film. Thickness changes increasing with applied potential were obtained for both voltages in the range |V appl| \le 600 mV. In NaCl, electrolyte films swell with application of negative potentials and shrink with positive potentials, due to the imbibing or extrusion of hydrated Na + ions, respectively. Thickness changes as large as 50\% can be achieved. An increase in the cross-linker content results in thicker films, but at the cost of dramatically restricted swelling. Response times are generally faster for smaller applied potentials, as expected if the volume change results from mass transport of electrolyte. (c) 2005 American Chemical Society.},

  abstract  = {A supramolecular hydrogel 1, prepared at high concentration (5-10 wt\%), exhibited mechanical toughness comparable to that of a polymer hydrogel, even though the gel was constructed solely by noncovalent bonding interactions among small molecules. The mechanical toughness and thermal reversibility of gel 1 allowed us to fabricate a supramolecular hydrogel capsule (SH-capsule) 1 which was easily handled and was stable in aqueous and cell culture media. The mechanical and substance-release/uptake properties of SH-capsule 1 were investigated by atomic force microscope (AFM) indentation, fluorescence spectroscopy, and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). On the basis of those properties we successfully designed an enzyme- and cell-responsive SH-capsule. To install a function of enzyme-responsive substance release into the SH-capsule 1, enzyme-labile, amphiphilic additive 2 was embedded in supramolecular nanofibers of 1 through a supramolecular co-assembly method. As a proof-of-concept, we constructed the functional SH-capsule 1/2 that can release a model fluorescent drug triggered by prostate specific antigen (PSA)-catalyzed proteolysis. Selective release of the fluorescent substance was exploited to both assay PSA activity and detect prostate cancer (PCa) cells. We also clearly demonstrated that the released fluorescent substance was delivered and internalized into the PCa cells, mediated by binding to the membrane-bound protein prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA), which is over-expressed on a plasma membrane of the PCa cells.},

  abstract  = {Hypothesis: Grafted poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate (POEGMA) copolymer brushes change conformation in response to temperature ('thermoresponse'). In the presence of different ions the thermoresponse of these coatings is dramatically altered. These effects are complex and poorly understood with no all-inclusive predictive theory of specific ion effects. As natural environments are composed of mixed electrolytes, it is imperative we understand the interplay of different ions for future applications. We hypothesise anion mixtures from the same end of the Hofmeister series (same-type anions) will exhibit non-additive and competitive behaviour. Experiments: The behaviour of POEGMA brushes, synthesised via surface-initiated ARGET-ATRP, in both single and mixed aqueous electrolyte solutions was characterised with ellipsometry and neutron reflectometry as a function of temperature. Findings: In mixed fluoride and chloride aqueous electrolytes (salting-out ions), or mixed thiocyanate and iodide aqueous electrolytes (salting-in ions), a non-monotonic concentration-dependent influence of the two anions on the thermoresponse of the brush was observed. A new term, $\Delta$, has been defined to quantitively describe synergistic or antagonistic behaviour. This study determined the specific ion effects imparted by salting-out ions are dependent on available solvent molecules, whereas the influence of salting-in ions is dependent on the interactions of the anions and polymer chains.},

  abstract  = {The hallmark of eukaryotic cells is the nucleus that contains the genome, enclosed by a physical barrier known as the nuclear envelope (NE). On the one hand, this compartmentalization endows the eukaryotic cells with high regulatory complexity and flexibility. On the other hand, it poses a tremendous logistic and energetic problem of transporting millions of molecules per second across the nuclear envelope, to facilitate their biological function in all compartments of the cell. Therefore, eukaryotes have evolved a molecular "nanomachine" known as the Nuclear Pore Complex (NPC). Embedded in the nuclear envelope, NPCs control and regulate all the bi-directional transport between the cell nucleus and the cytoplasm. NPCs combine high molecular specificity of transport with high throughput and speed, and are highly robust with respect to molecular noise and structural perturbations. Remarkably, the functional mechanisms of NPC transport are highly conserved among eukaryotes, from yeast to humans, despite significant differences in the molecular components among various species. The NPC is the largest macromolecular complex in the cell. Yet, despite its significant complexity, it has become clear that its principles of operation can be largely understood based on fundamental physical concepts, as have emerged from a combination of experimental methods of molecular cell biology, biophysics, nanoscience and theoretical and computational modeling. Indeed, many aspects of NPC function can be recapitulated in artificial mimics with a drastically reduced complexity compared to biological pores. We review the current physical understanding of the NPC architecture and function, with the focus on the critical analysis of experimental studies in cells and artificial NPC mimics through the lens of theoretical and computational models. We also discuss the connections between the emerging concepts of NPC operation and other areas of biophysics and bionanotechnology.},

   abstract = {The most comprehensive architectural model to date of the nuclear pore complex reveals previously unknown local interactions, and a role for nucleoporin 358 in Y-complex oligomerization. The transport of materials between the nucleus and cytoplasm in eukaryotic cells is controlled by the nuclear pore complex. Martin Beck and colleagues have used cryo-electron tomography, mass spectrometry and other analyses to generate the most comprehensive architectural model of the human nuclear pore complex to date. The model reveals previously unknown local interactions, and a role for the transport channel nucleoporin 358 (Nup358) in mediating oligomerization of the Y-complex within the nuclear pore complex. Nuclear pore complexes are fundamental components of all eukaryotic cells that mediate nucleocytoplasmic exchange. Determining their 110-megadalton structure imposes a formidable challenge and requires in situ structural biology approaches. Of approximately 30 nucleoporins (Nups), 15 are structured and form the Y and inner-ring complexes. These two major scaffolding modules assemble in multiple copies into an eight-fold rotationally symmetric structure that fuses the inner and outer nuclear membranes to form a central channel of ~60 nm in diameter1. The scaffold is decorated with transport-channel Nups that often contain phenylalanine-repeat sequences and mediate the interaction with cargo complexes. Although the architectural arrangement of parts of the Y complex has been elucidated, it is unclear how exactly it oligomerizes in situ. Here we combine cryo-electron tomography with mass spectrometry, biochemical analysis, perturbation experiments and structural modelling to generate, to our knowledge, the most comprehensive architectural model of the human nuclear pore complex to date. Our data suggest previously unknown protein interfaces across Y complexes and to inner-ring complex members. We show that the transport-channel Nup358 (also known as Ranbp2) has a previously unanticipated role in Y-complex oligomerization. Our findings blur the established boundaries between scaffold and transport-channel Nups. We conclude that, similar to coated vesicles, several copies of the same structural building block - although compositionally identical - engage in different local sets of interactions and conformations.},

These membranes are based on alumina films that have cylindrical pores with monodisperse nanoscopic diameters (for example, 20 nanometers). Silica nanotubes were chemically synthesized within the pores of these films, and an antibody that selectively binds one of the enantiomers of the drug was attached to the inner walls of the silica nanotubes. These membranes selectively transport the enantiomer that specifically binds to the antibody, relative to the enantiomer that has lower affinity for the antibody. The solvent dimethyl sulfoxide was used to tune the antibody binding affinity, The enantiomeric selectivity coefficient increases as the inside diameter of the silica nanotubes decreases.},

Atomic force microscopy force measurements on this system show that projection domains exert a long-range ( > 100 nm) repulsive force.

   abstract = {Nuclear pore complexes selectively transport cargoes across the nuclear envelope. Now, two studies published in this issue follow the movement of single cargo proteins (Lowe et al.) and mRNA transcripts (David Gr\"unwald and Robert Singer) as they translocate across the nuclear envelope, with nanometre precision and high temporal resolution. They discover previously unidentified transport sub-steps and provide fundamental insight into the mechanism of selective transport through the nuclear pore complexes. Nuclear pore complexes selectively transport cargos across the nuclear envelope. Here, a nuclear transport assay has been developed that allows the movement of single cargo proteins to be followed in real time. A succession of transport substeps is observed, and the NPC is found to be functionally asymmetric to importing cargos. The study provides insight into the mechanism of selective transport through the NPC. The nuclear pore complex (NPC) mediates all exchange between the cytoplasm and the nucleus. Small molecules can passively diffuse through the NPC, whereas larger cargos require transport receptors to translocate1. How the NPC facilitates the translocation of transport receptor/cargo complexes remains unclear. To investigate this process, we tracked single protein-functionalized quantum dot cargos as they moved through human NPCs. Here we show that import proceeds by successive substeps comprising cargo capture, filtering and translocation, and release into the nucleus. Most quantum dots are rejected at one of these steps and return to the cytoplasm, including very large cargos that abort at a size-selective barrier. Cargo movement in the central channel is subdiffusive and cargos that can bind more transport receptors diffuse more freely. Without Ran GTPase, a critical regulator of transport directionality, cargos still explore the entire NPC, but have a markedly reduced probability of exit into the nucleus, suggesting that NPC entry and exit steps are not equivalent and that the pore is functionally asymmetric to importing cargos. The overall selectivity of the NPC seems to arise from the cumulative action of multiple reversible substeps and a final irreversible exit step.},

Here, we applied cryo-electron tomography to human fibroblast cells, reconstructing their nuclear envelopes without applying any purification steps.

Overall, the smaller yNPC is comprised of an octagonal inner spoke ring that is anchored within the nuclear envelope by a novel membrane-interacting ring. In addition, a cylindrical transporter is located centrally within the spokes and exhibits a variable radial expansion in projection that may reflect gating. The inner spoke ring, a transmembrane spoke domain, and the transporter are conserved between yeast and vertebrates; hence, they are required to form a functional NPC. However, significant alterations in NPC architecture have arisen during evolution that may be correlated with differences in nuclear transport regulation or mitotic behavior.},

   abstract = {The nuclear pore complex (NPC) and its relationship to the nuclear envelope (NE) was characterized in living cells using POM121-green fluorescent protein (GFP) and GFP-Nup153, and GFP-lamin B1. No independent movement of single pore complexes was found within the plane of the NE in interphase. Only large arrays of NPCs moved slowly and synchronously during global changes in nuclear shape, strongly suggesting mechanical connections which form an NPC network. The nuclear lamina exhibited identical movements. NPC turnover measured by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching of POM121 was less than once per cell cycle. Nup153 association with NPCs was dynamic and turnover of this nucleoporin was three orders of magnitude faster. Overexpression of both nucleoporins induced the formation of annulate lamellae (AL) in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Turnover of AL pore complexes was much higher than in the NE (once every 2.5 min). During mitosis, POM121 and Nup153 were completely dispersed and mobile in the ER (POM121) or cytosol (Nup153) in metaphase, and rapidly redistributed to an immobilized pool around chromatin in late anaphase. Assembly and immobilization of both nucleoporins occurred before detectable recruitment of lamin B1, which is thus unlikely to mediate initiation of NPC assembly at the end of mitosis.},

In consideration of this, the present experiments were performed to (a) identify the specific sites within the envelope through which transport occurs and (b) determine if molecular size is a limiting factor in the transport process. The following experimental procedure was employed: Colloidal gold particles, varying in size from ~20 to 170 \AA\ in diameter were coated with nucleoplasmin, a 165,000-mol-wt karyophilic protein, which is known to be transported through the envelope. The coated gold particles were microinjected into the cytoplasm of Xenopus oocytes, and the cells were fixed 15 min and 1 h later. The intracellular localization of the gold was then determined with the electron microscope. It was found that nucleoplasmin-coated particles readily enter the nucleus. On the basis of the distribution of the particles associated with the envelope, we concluded that transport occurs through the nuclear pores. Furthermore, the size distributions of the gold particles present in the nucleus and cytoplasm were not significantly different, indicating that the envelope does not discriminate among particles with diameters ranging from 50 to 200 \AA\ (the dimensions including the nucleoplasmin coat). Colloidal gold coated with trypsin-digested nucleoplasmin (which lacks the polypeptide domain required for transport) or exogenous polyvinylpyrrolidone were largely excluded from the nucleus and showed no evidence of transport.},

However, all experimental strategies realized so far confined the observation to extremely thin interfacial layers. The detection and characterization of single molecules in three-dimensionally extended systems such as living cells has yet to be accomplished. We show, here, for the first time that single protein molecules can be visualized and tracked in three-dimensional (3D) samples at room temperature. Using a wide-field fluorescence microscope equipped with an Ar+-laser and a low-light-level CCD camera, single molecules of the green fluorescent protein (GFP) were detected in gels and viscous solutions at depths of up to ~10 $\mu$m from the interface. A time resolution of 5 ms was achieved by a high-speed framing mode. The two- dimensional localization accuracy was determined to be ~30 nm. The number of photons emitted by single GFP molecules before photodestruction was found to be ≤ 4 * 105. Freely diffusing GFP molecules could be tracked over up to nine images acquired at a frame rate of ~80 Hz. From the trajectories, the diffusion coefficients of single GFP molecules were derived and found to agree well with expectation and microphotolysis measurements. Our results imply that the visualization and tracking of single molecules in living cells is possible.},

Brownian dynamics simulations replicate these findings and indicate that the soft barrier results from the highly dynamic FG repeat domains and the diffusing macromolecules mutually constraining and competing for available volume in the interior of the NPC, setting up entropic repulsion forces. We found that FG domains with exceptionally high net charge and low hydropathy near the cytoplasmic end of the central channel contribute more strongly to obstruction of passive diffusion than to facilitated transport, revealing a compartmentalized functional arrangement within the NPC.},

Based on the model, a versatile restrictive factor expression was proposed to describe the correlation between the effective diffusivity and the ratio of molecular diameter to pore diameter. Various variations of restrictive factor versus the ratio of molecular diameter to pore diameter from reported literatures were interpreted better than previous restrictive factor equations. Especially, the restrictive factor with non-monotonic variations could not be explained with the reported restrictive factor equations, but interpreted well by equation in this work. Furthermore, the diffusion tortuosity was first proposed herein to account for the effect of molecule diffusion path on diffusion behavior in pores.},

A frequent observation is that if the pore dimensions are of the same order as those of a solute molecule, the apparent diffusion coefficient of that solute is much lower than in bulk solution. Likewise, rates of convective transport of such solutes are general"y lower than the product of bulk concentration and volume flow rate. Thus, solute transport is typically "hindered" or restricted. A key objective of research on hindered transport is to be able to predict the applicable transport coefficients from such fundamental information as the size, shape, and electrical charge of the solutes and pores.

The technique is an improvement over conventional "lubrication-theory" analyses. Asymptotic expansions, valid for small dimensionless clearances, are obtained for the hydrodynamic force, torque and pressure drop for flow past a stationary sphere, as well as for the case of a sphere translating or rotating in an otherwise quiescent fluid. These expansions are employed to predict the macroscopic behavior of both a neutrally-buoyant sphere suspended in a Poiseuille flow, and a sedimenting sphere in a vertical tube. The results find application in capillary blood flow, pipeline transport of encapsulated materials, and falling-ball viscometers.}

Mica membranes, 3 to 5 micrometers thick, were prepared with uniform, straight pores from 90 to 600 angstroms in diameter. With these membranes a direct estimation was possible of the interaction between pore size and molecular diffusion rates. There were no uncertainties due to wide pore size distributions or nonuniform tortuous channels as in previously used model microporous materials such as dialysis tubing or gels. Aqueous diffusion rates through these mica membranes were measured for a series of compounds with molecular diameters from 5.2 to 43 angstroms and were corrected for "liquid film resistances" adjacent to the membrane-solution interface to obtain estimates of molecular diffusivities within the micropores of the membrane. Definite evidence is presented showing that, even when molecular size is a small fraction of pore size, diffusion rates decrease markedly. The apparent reduction in solute diffusivity in the microporous membrane can be quantitatively estimated by means of the Renkin equation for hindered diffusion.}

Consequently, many aspects of its architecture, general function, and role in the life cycle of a cell are well understood. Over the last decade, fluorescence microscopy methods have enabled the real-time visualization of single molecules interacting with and transiting through the NPC, allowing novel questions to be examined with nanometer precision. While initial single-molecule studies focused primarily on import pathways using permeabilized cells, it has recently proven feasible to investigate the export of mRNAs in living cells. Single-molecule assays can address questions that are difficult or impossible to answer by other means, yet the complexity of nucleocytoplasmic transport requires that interpretation be based on a firm genetic, biochemical, and structural foundation. Moreover, conceptually simple single-molecule experiments remain technically challenging, particularly with regard to signal intensity, signal-to-noise ratio, and the analysis of noise, stochasticity, and precision. We discuss nuclear transport issues recently addressed by single-molecule microscopy, evaluate the limits of existing assays and data, and identify open questions for future studies. We expect that single-molecule fluorescence approaches will continue to be applied to outstanding nucleocytoplasmic transport questions, and that the approaches developed for NPC studies are extendable to additional complex systems and pathways within cells.},

The precise mechanism of facilitated translocation remains unclear due to the challenges of measuring the series of transient interactions between a transport receptor and the FG-Nups. This study developed single-point edge-excitation subdiffraction microscopy to obtain a three-dimensional density map of the transient interactions with a spatiotemporal resolution of 9 nm and 400 μs. Three unique features were observed under real-time trafficking conditions that have escaped detection by conventional electron microscopy: (i) the spatial density of interaction sites between Importin \beta1 (Imp \beta1, a major transport receptor) and the FG-Nups gradually increases from both sides of the NPC and is highest in the central pore region; (ii) cargofree or cargo-bound Imp \beta1 rarely occupies an axial channel with a diameter of approximately 10-20 nm at its narrowest point through the NPC; and (iii) the pathway of facilitated translocation through the NPC depends more on the interaction sites of the FG-Nups than on the NPC architecture.},

   abstract = {Nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) are biological nanomachines that mediate the bidirectional traffic of macromolecules between the cytoplasm and nucleus in eukaryotic cells. This process involves numerous intrinsically disordered, barrier-forming proteins known as phenylalanine-glycine nucleoporins (FG Nups) that are tethered inside each pore. The selective barrier mechanism has so far remained unresolved because the FG Nups have eluded direct structural analysis within NPCs. Here, high-speed atomic force microscopy is used to visualize the nanoscopic spatiotemporal dynamics of FG Nups inside Xenopus laevis oocyte NPCs at timescales of ∼100 ms. Our results show that the cytoplasmic orifice is circumscribed by highly flexible, dynamically fluctuating FG Nups that rapidly elongate and retract, consistent with the diffusive motion of tethered polypeptide chains. On this basis, intermingling FG Nups exhibit transient entanglements in the central channel, but do not cohere into a tightly crosslinked meshwork. Therefore, the basic functional form of the NPC barrier is comprised of highly dynamic FG Nups that manifest as a central plug or transporter when averaged in space and time. High-speed atomic force microscopy can visualize the dynamics of phenylalanine-glycine nucleoporins inside nuclear pore complexes and reveals the selective barrier mechanism within these molecular machines.},

   abstract = {Transport of macromolecules across the nuclear envelope is an active process that depends on soluble factors including the GTPase Ran. Ran-GTP is predominantly located in the nucleus and has been shown to regulate cargo binding and release of import and export receptors in their respective target compartments. Recently, it was shown that transport of receptor-cargo complexes across the nuclear pore complex (NPC) does not depend on GTP- hydrolysis by Ran; however, the mechanism of translocation is still poorly understood. Here, we show that the direction of transport through the NPC can be inverted in the presence of high concentrations of cytoplasmic Ran-GTP. Under these conditions, two different classes of export cargoes are transported into the nucleus in the absence of GTP hydrolysis. The inverted transport is very rapid and can be blocked by known inhibitors of nuclear protein export. These results suggest that the NPC functions as a facilitated transport channel, allowing the selective translocation of receptor-cargo complexes. We conclude that the directionality of nucleocytoplasmic transport is determined mainly by the compartmentalized distribution of Ran-GTP.},

   abstract = {We theoretically study the diffusion of a single attractive nanoparticle (NP) in unentangled and entangled polymer melts based on combining microscopic "core-shell" and "vehicle" mechanisms in a dynamic bond percolation theory framework. A physical picture is constructed which addresses the role of chain length (N), degree of entanglement, nanoparticle size, and NP-polymer attraction strength. The nanoparticle diffusion constant is predicted to initially decrease with N due to the dominance of the core-shell mechanism, then to cross over to the vehicle diffusion regime with a weaker N dependence, and eventually plateau at large enough N. This behavior corresponds to decoupling of NP diffusivity from the macroscopic melt viscosity, which is reminiscent of repulsive NPs in entangled melts, but here it occurs for a distinct physical reason. Specifically, it reflects a crossover to a transport mechanism whereby nanoparticles adsorb on polymer chains and diffuse using them as "vehicles" over a characteristic desorption time scale. Repetition of random desorption events then leads to Fickian long time NP diffusion. Complementary simulations for a range of chain lengths and low to moderate NP-polymer attraction strengths are also performed. They allow testing of the proposed diffusion mechanisms and qualitatively support the theoretically predicted dynamic crossover behavior. When the desorption time is smaller than or comparable to the onset of entangled polymer dynamics, the NP diffusivity becomes almost chain length independent.},

A fundamental understanding of the microscopic parameters that govern nanoparticle diffusion is relevant to a wide range of applications. In this work, we present experimental measurements of the tracer diffusion coefficient of small and large nanoparticles that experience strong attractions with unentangled and entangled polymer melt matrices. For the small nanoparticle system, a crossover from suppressed to enhanced diffusion is observed with increasing polymer molecular weight. We interpret these observations based on our theoretical and simulation insights of the preceding article (paper 1) as a result of a crossover from an effective hydrodynamic core-shell to a nonhydrodynamic vehicle mechanism of transport, with the latter strongly dependent on polymer-nanoparticle desorption time. A general zeroth-order qualitative picture for small sticky nanoparticle diffusion in polymer melts is proposed.},

   abstract = {We present a method to probe molecular and nanoparticle diffusion within thin, solvated polymer coatings. The device exploits the confinement with well-defined geometry that forms at the interface between a planar and a hemispherical surface (of which at least one is coated with polymers) in close contact and uses this confinement to analyze diffusion processes without interference of exchange with and diffusion in the bulk solution. With this method, which we call plane-sphere confinement microscopy (PSCM), information regarding the partitioning of molecules between the polymer coating and the bulk liquid is also obtained. Thanks to the shape of the confined geometry, diffusion and partitioning can be mapped as a function of compression and concentration of the coating in a single experiment. The method is versatile and can be integrated with conventional optical microscopes; thus it should find widespread use in the many application areas exploiting functional polymer coatings. We demonstrate the use of PSCM using brushes of natively unfolded nucleoporin domains rich in phenylalanine-glycine repeats (FG domains). A meshwork of FG domains is known to be responsible for the selective transport of nuclear transport receptors (NTRs) and their macromolecular cargos across the nuclear envelope that separates the cytosol and the nucleus of living cells. We find that the selectivity of NTR uptake by FG domain films depends sensitively on FG domain concentration and that the interaction of NTRs with FG domains obstructs NTR movement only moderately. These observations contribute important information to better understand the mechanisms of selective NTR transport.},

abstract = {This work presents a theoretical study of the translocation routes of nanoparticles through polymer-brush modified nanopores. The calculations were performed with a molecular theory that explicitly accounts for the shape, size, conformations and interactions of all molecular species in the system. This work reports molecular-theory calculations allowing inhomogeneities in the three spatial dimensions, which allows us to study for the first time off-axis translocation routes, i.e. routes that do not coincide with the axis of the pore. Free-energy landscapes within the pore were obtained for particles of different sizes and affinity for the polymer brush. The minimum free-energy paths on these landscapes determine the translocation routes. Decreasing the size of the particle or increasing its affinity for the polymer, shifts the translocation route from the central axis of the pore towards its walls. Interestingly, for a given polymer-particle affinity, there exists an intermediate particle size that results in the most flat potential of mean force for translocation, therefore, that will optimize the rate of translocation.}

   abstract = {Nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) conduct massive transport mediated by shuttling nuclear transport receptors (NTRs), while keeping nuclear and cytoplasmic contents separated. The NPC barrier in Xenopus relies primarily on the intrinsically disordered FG domain of Nup98. We now observed that Nup98 FG domains of mammals, lancelets, insects, nematodes, fungi, plants, amoebas, ciliates, and excavates spontaneously and rapidly phase-separate from dilute (submicromolar) aqueous solutions into characteristic 'FG particles'. This required neither sophisticated experimental conditions nor auxiliary eukaryotic factors. Instead, it occurred already during FG domain expression in bacteria. All Nup98 FG phases rejected inert macromolecules and yet allowed far larger NTR cargo complexes to rapidly enter. They even recapitulated the observations that large cargo-domains counteract NPC passage of NTR⋅cargo complexes, while cargo shielding and increased NTR⋅cargo surface-ratios override this inhibition. Their exquisite NPC-typical sorting selectivity and strong intrinsic assembly propensity suggest that Nup98 FG phases can form in authentic NPCs and indeed account for the permeability properties of the pore.},

@article{Vovk2016,
   abstract = {Nuclear Pore Complexes (NPCs) are key cellular transporter that control nucleocytoplasmic transport in eukaryotic cells, but its transport mechanism is still not understood. The centerpiece of NPC transport is the assembly of intrinsically disordered polypeptides, known as FG nucleoporins, lining its passageway. Their conformations and collective dynamics during transport are difficult to assess in vivo. In vitro investigations provide partially conflicting results, lending support to different models of transport, which invoke various conformational transitions of the FG nucleoporins induced by the cargo-carrying transport proteins. We show that the spatial organization of FG nucleoporin assemblies with the transport proteins can be understood within a first principles biophysical model with a minimal number of key physical variables, such as the average protein interaction strengths and spatial densities. These results address some of the outstanding controversies and suggest how molecularly divergent NPCs in different species can perform essentially the same function.},

The key component of the functional architecture of the NPC is the assembly of intrinsically disordered proteins that line its passageway and play a central role in the NPC transport mechanism. Due to paucity of experimental methods capable to directly probe the morphology of this assembly in intact NPCs, much of our knowledge about its properties derives from in vitro experiments augmented by theoretical and computational modeling. I review the major insights into the biophysics of the assemblies of the intrinsically disordered proteins of the NPC arising from the theoretical analysis of the recent in vitro experimental results, with the emphasis on the phase separation and aggregation phenomena.},

@article{Popken2015,
   abstract = {Nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) allow selective import and export while forming a barrier for untargeted proteins. Using fluorescence microscopy, we measured in vivo the permeability of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae NPC for multidomain proteins of different sizes and found that soluble proteins of 150 kDa and membrane proteins with an extralumenal domain of 90 kDa were still partly localized in the nucleus on a time scale of hours. The NPCs thus form only a weak barrier for the majority of yeast proteins, given their monomeric size. Using FGΔ-mutant strains, we showed that specific combinations of Nups, especially with Nup100, but not the total mass of FG-nups per pore, were important for forming the barrier. Models of the disordered phase of wild-type and mutant NPCs were generated using a one bead per amino acid molecular dynamics model. The permeability measurements correlated with the density predictions from coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations in the center of the NPC. The combined in vivo and computational approach provides a framework for elucidating the structural and functional properties of the permeability barrier of nuclear pore complexes.},
