  abstract  = {Abstract While the murine equivalent to “5q- syndrome” should map to the distal arms of murine chromosomes 11 and 18, molecular attempts have been unsuccessful in generating a reliable mouse model of myelodysplasia leading to exacerbated myeloid leukemia. Genetic studies suggest interactions between individual proteins in this locus suppress tumor initiation. More specifically, cellular and biochemical studies demonstrated collaboration between two proteins in the commonly deleted regions of 5q– syndrome: mDia1 (mammalian Diaphanous-related Rho GTPase effector formin) and APC (adenomatous polypolis coli). Therefore, we generated mice compounding these two putative disease alleles. Because both mDia1 knockout [Drf1(–/–)] mice and Apcmin (min = multiple intestinal neoplasia; haploinsufficient) mice develop age-dependent myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), we hypothesized that a mouse strain lacking both proteins will exhibit a more severe MDS phenotype than either mutant allele alone. To define the disease caused by mutation in Drf1 and Apcmin, we monitored erythropoiesis, myelopoiesis, and overall survival. At all ages, mice with both mutant alleles exhibit granulocytosis. Anemia occurs in aged mice (\&gt;270 days), exhibiting drastic differences in blood cell morphology that corresponded to differences in long-term survival in comparison to either Drf1–/– or Apcmin animals. Furthermore, immunophenotyping of all subpopulations indicate an accumulation of CD71+/TER-119+ cells in mice with both mutant alleles, however no significant differences in CD11b expression appeared among CD45+ bone marrow subpopulations. Our studies indicate that combined loss of mDia1 and APC expression and function direct disease progression. We are currently defining the hematopoietic precursor cell responsible for anemia and bone marrow failure. This enhanced mouse model also serves as molecular laboratory to study disease progression and to test potential therapeutics under development in our laboratory.

  abstract     = {Nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) lined with intrinsically disordered FG-domains act as selective gatekeepers for molecular transport between the nucleus and the cytoplasm in eukaryotic cells. The underlying physical mechanism of the intriguing selectivity is still under debate. Here, we probe the transport of ions and transport receptors through biomimetic NPCs consisting of Nsp1 domains attached to the inner surface of solid-state nanopores. We examine both wildtype FG-domains and hydrophilic SG-mutants. FG-nanopores showed a clear selectivity as transport receptors can translocate across the pore whereas other proteins cannot. SG mutant pores lack such selectivity. To unravel this striking difference, we present coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations that reveal that FG-pores exhibit a high-density, nonuniform protein distribution, in contrast to a uniform and significantly less-dense protein distribution in the SG-mutant. We conclude that the sequence-dependent density distribution of disordered proteins inside the NPC plays a key role for its conductivity and selective permeability.},

  abstract  = {Abstract Bottom-up surface processing with well-defined polymeric structures becomes increasingly important in many current technologies. Polymer brushes, that is, assemblies of macromolecules tethered at one end to a substrate, provide an exemplary system of materials capable of achieving such a goal. While the focus in the past decades has been mostly on their synthetic aspects and the in-depth study of their interesting properties, from several years now the core area of research has already started to shift towards specific practical applications. Ample functional versatility and relative ease of preparation are special strengths of polymer brushes, lending them a strong interdisciplinary character. To this end, this work is entirely dedicated to bringing together the latest research on applications of polymer brushes in multiple research fields. The aim of this review are twofold: first, to give a critical discussion of the current status of development of application-oriented research on polymer brushes, and second, to inform the reader as to what can be done with polymer brushes in multiple research fields. It is therefore hoped that the juxtaposition of perspectives from different disciplines in one place will stimulate and contribute to the ongoing process of cross-fertilization that is driving this fascinating and emerging area of polymer science. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

  abstract = {The hindrance effect on the aqueous diffusion rate of solutes within membrane pores of molecular size has been accurately determined. Mica membranes, 3 to 5 micrometers thick, were prepared with uniform, straight pores from 90 to 600 angstroms in diameter. With these membranes a direct estimation was possible of the interaction between pore size and molecular diffusion rates. There were no uncertainties due to wide pore size distributions or nonuniform tortuous channels as in previously used model microporous materials such as dialysis tubing or gels. Aqueous diffusion rates through these mica membranes were measured for a series of compounds with molecular diameters from 5.2 to 43 angstroms and were corrected for "liquid film resistances" adjacent to the membrane-solution interface to obtain estimates of molecular diffusivities within the micropores of the membrane. Definite evidence is presented showing that, even when molecular size is a small fraction of pore size, diffusion rates decrease markedly. The apparent reduction in solute diffusivity in the microporous membrane can be quantitatively estimated by means of the Renkin equation for hindered diffusion.},

Traffic is regulated by mobile transport receptors that target their cargo to the central translocation channel, where phenylalanine-glycine-rich repeats serve as binding sites. The structural analysis of the nuclear pore is a formidable challenge given its size, its location in a membranous environment and its dynamic nature. Here we have used cryo-electron tomography to study the structure of nuclear pore complexes in their functional environment, that is, in intact nuclei of Dictyostelium discoideum. A new image-processing strategy compensating for deviations of the asymmetric units (protomers) from a perfect eight-fold symmetry enabled us to refine the structure and to identify new features. Furthermore, the superposition of a large number of tomograms taken in the presence of cargo, which was rendered visible by gold nanoparticles, has yielded a map outlining the trajectories of import cargo. Finally, we have performed single-molecule Monte Carlo simulations of nuclear import to interpret the experimentally observed cargo distribution in the light of existing models for nuclear import.},

The method takes into account the effect of short-range interactions in polymer chains, in particular, the chain stiffness and secondary structure. The theory of adsorption of chains of different stiffness is developed, and the process of adsorption which occurs when the external conditions change is shown to be always a second-order phase transition. The critical adsorption energy decreases and the sharpness of transition grows when the chain stiffness increases. A simple model of a chain with "virtual" steps is proposed which simplifies the treatment; the results obtained are in good agreement with exact theories. A general scheme of analysis of adsorption of chains with a given secondary structure is set forth and the analogy between the stiffness of a noncooperative chain and the presence of helical segments in a polypeptide chain is discussed.

The technique is an improvement over conventional "lubrication-theory" analyses. Asymptotic expansions, valid for small dimensionless clearances, are obtained for the hydrodynamic force, torque and pressure drop for flow past a stationary sphere, as well as for the case of a sphere translating or rotating in an otherwise quiescent fluid. These expansions are employed to predict the macroscopic behavior of both a neutrally-buoyant sphere suspended in a Poiseuille flow, and a sedimenting sphere in a vertical tube.

Particles with size smaller than the solution correlation length $\xi$ undergo ordinary diffusion ($\langle \Delta r^2(t) \rangle \sim t$) with a diffusion coefficient similar to that in pure solvent. The motion of particles of intermediate size ($\xi < d < a$), where $a$ is the tube diameter for entangled polymer liquids, is subdiffusive ($\langle \Delta r^2(t) \rangle \sim t^{1/2}$) at short time scales since their motion is affected by subsections of polymer chains. At long time scales, the motion of these particles is diffusive, and their diffusion coefficient is determined by the effective viscosity of a polymer liquid with chains of size comparable to the particle diameter $d$. The motion of particles larger than the tube diameter $a$ at time scales shorter than the relaxation time $\tau_e$ of an entanglement strand is similar to the motion of particles of intermediate size. At longer time scales ($t > \tau_e$), large particles ($d > a$) are trapped by the entanglement mesh, and to move further they have to wait for the surrounding polymer chains to relax at the reptation time scale $\tau_{\mathrm{rep}}$. At longer times $t > \tau_{\mathrm{rep}}$, the motion of such large particles ($d > a$) is diffusive with a diffusion coefficient determined by the bulk viscosity of the entangled polymer liquids.

However, there are many fluids where the SE prediction for nanoparticles diffusion fails. These systems include diffusion of nanoparticles in porous media, in entangled and unentangled polymer melts and solutions, and protein diffusion in biological environments. A fundamental understanding of the microscopic parameters that govern nanoparticle diffusion is relevant to a wide range of applications. In this work, we present experimental measurements of the tracer diffusion coefficient of small and large nanoparticles that experience strong attractions with unentangled and entangled polymer melt matrices. For the small nanoparticle system, a crossover from suppressed to enhanced diffusion is observed with increasing polymer molecular weight. We interpret these observations based on our theoretical and simulation insights of the preceding article (paper 1) as a result of a crossover from an effective hydrodynamic core-shell to a nonhydrodynamic vehicle mechanism of transport, with the latter strongly dependent on polymer-nanoparticle desorption time. A general zeroth-order qualitative picture for small sticky nanoparticle diffusion in polymer melts is proposed.},

We show that a complex of ssDNA and polyisopropylacrylamide diffuses faster through the modified pores than does the bare ssDNA, in spite of the larger size of the complex. The mobile polymer thus acts as a soluble receptor to usher a macromolecular cargo specifically through the pores. (c) 2008 American Chemical Society.},

  abstract  = {The nuclear pore complex (NPC) and its relationship to the nuclear envelope (NE) was characterized in living cells using POM121-green fluorescent protein (GFP) and GFP-Nup153, and GFP-lamin B1. No independent movement of single pore complexes was found within the plane of the NE in interphase. Only large arrays of NPCs moved slowly and synchronously during global changes in nuclear shape, strongly suggesting mechanical connections which form an NPC network. The nuclear lamina exhibited identical movements. NPC turnover measured by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching of POM121 was less than once per cell cycle. Nup153 association with NPCs was dynamic and turnover of this nucleoporin was three orders of magnitude faster. Overexpression of both nucleoporins induced the formation of annulate lamellae (AL) in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Turnover of AL pore complexes was much higher than in the NE (once every 2.5 min). During mitosis, POM121 and Nup153 were completely dispersed and mobile in the ER (POM121) or cytosol (Nup153) in metaphase, and rapidly redistributed to an immobilized pool around chromatin in late anaphase. Assembly and immobilization of both nucleoporins occurred before detectable recruitment of lamin B1, which is thus unlikely to mediate initiation of NPC assembly at the end of mitosis.},

  abstract  = {Transport in liquid-filled pores of molecular dimensions plays an important role in membrane separations, in various forms of chromatography, and in catalysis, to name a few examples. A frequent observation is that if the pore dimensions are of the same order as those of a solute molecule, the apparent diffusion coefficient of that solute is much lower than in bulk solution. Likewise, rates of convective transport of such solutes are general"y lower than the product of bulk concentration and volume flow rate. Thus, solute transport is typically "hindered" or restricted. A key objective of research on hindered transport is to be able to predict the applicable transport coefficients from such fundamental information as the size, shape, and electrical charge of the solutes and pores.

  abstract  = {The nuclear pore complex (NPC) is a macromolecular assembly embedded within the nuclear envelope that mediates bidirectional exchange of material between the nucleus and cytoplasm. Our recent work on the yeast NPC has revealed a simple modularity in its architecture and suggested a common evolutionary origin of the NPC and vesicle coating complexes in a progenitor protocoatomer. However, detailed compositional and structural information is currently only available for vertebrate and yeast NPCs, which are evolutionarily closely related. Hence our understanding of NPC composition in a full evolutionary context is sparse. Moreover despite the ubiquitous nature of the NPC, sequence searches in distant taxa have identified surprisingly few NPC components, suggesting that much of the NPC may not be conserved. Thus, to gain a broad perspective on the origins and evolution of the NPC, we performed proteomics analyses of NPC-containing fractions from a divergent eukaryote (Trypanosoma brucei) and obtained a comprehensive inventory of its nucleoporins. Strikingly trypanosome nucleoporins clearly share with metazoa and yeast their fold type, domain organization, composition, and modularity. Overall these data provide conclusive evidence that the majority of NPC architecture is indeed conserved throughout the Eukaryota and was already established in the last common eukaryotic ancestor. These findings strongly support the hypothesis that NPCs share a common ancestry with vesicle coating complexes and that both were established very early in eukaryotic evolution.

Recent research has also focused on the roles nucleoporins play in health and disease, some of which go beyond nucleocytoplasmic transport.

In addition to resolving individual protein domains of the NPC constituents, we propose a model for the architecture of the molecular gate at its central channel. Furthermore, we compare and contrast this native NPC structure to one that exhibits reduced transport activity and unveil the spatial properties of the NPC gate. Nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) are large macromolecular assemblies that mediate the exchange of molecules between the nucleus and cytoplasm.

A selective permeability barrier that arises from a supramolecular assembly of intrinsically unfolded nucleoporin domains rich in phenylalanine-glycine dipeptides (FG domains) fills the nuclear pore. There is increasing evidence that selective transport requires cohesive FG domain interactions. To understand the functional roles of cohesive interactions, we studied monolayers of end-grafted FG domains as a bottom-up nanoscale model system of the permeability barrier. Based on detailed physicochemical analysis of the model films and comparison of the data with polymer theory, we propose that cohesiveness is tuned to promote rapid assembly of the permeability barrier and to generate a stable and compact pore-filling meshwork with a small mesh size. Our results highlight the functional importance of weak interactions, typically a few kBT per chain, and contribute important information to understand the mechanism of size-selective transport.},

Particular attention is paid to the region around the temperature Ta below which the polymer becomes adsorbed to the wall, i.e., where the typical polymer linear dimensions perpendicular to the wall become independent of chain length. Both ideal noninteracting chains and chains with excluded volume interactions are treated. Polymer linear dimensions parallel and perpendicular to the wall and their probability distributions are studied, as well as the behavior of the monomer fraction at the surface and a distance z in the interior. The relation of polymer statistics to the problem of correlation functions in the n-vector model of magnetism in the limit n->0 is exploited to express both the exponents describing the various power laws and the crossover scaling functions near Ta in terms of results for the analogous problem of the critical behavior of magnets with a free surface. The predictions of this scaling theory are confirmed by Monte Carlo studies of self-avoiding walks on the tetrahedral lattice with a free surface, and estimates for the exponents involved are presented. A new sampling technique with a bias in favor of adsorbed polymer configurations is developed. {\textcopyright} 1982 American Institute of Physics.},

In consideration of this, the present experiments were performed to (a) identify the specific sites within the envelope through which transport occurs and (b) determine if molecular size is a limiting factor in the transport process. The following experimental procedure was employed: Colloidal gold particles, varying in size from ~20 to 170 \AA\ in diameter were coated with nucleoplasmin, a 165,000-mol-wt karyophilic protein, which is known to be transported through the envelope. The coated gold particles were microinjected into the cytoplasm of Xenopus oocytes, and the cells were fixed 15 min and 1 h later. The intracellular localization of the gold was then determined with the electron microscope. It was found that nucleoplasmin-coated particles readily enter the nucleus. On the basis of the distribution of the particles associated with the envelope, we concluded that transport occurs through the nuclear pores. Furthermore, the size distributions of the gold particles present in the nucleus and cytoplasm were not significantly different, indicating that the envelope does not discriminate among particles with diameters ranging from 50 to 200 \AA\ (the dimensions including the nucleoplasmin coat). Colloidal gold coated with trypsin-digested nucleoplasmin (which lacks the polypeptide domain required for transport) or exogenous polyvinylpyrrolidone were largely excluded from the nucleus and showed no evidence of transport.},

We pay special attention to the case of charged polymers (polyelectrolytes) that have a special importance due to their water solubility. We present a summary of recent progress in this rapidly evolving field. Because many experimental studies are performed with rather stiff biopolymers, we discuss in detail the case of semi-flexible polymers in addition to flexible ones. We first review the behavior of neutral and charged chains in solution. Then, the adsorption of a single polymer chain is considered. Next, the adsorption and depletion processes in the many-chain case are reviewed. Profiles, changes in the surface tension and polymer surface excess are presented. Mean-field and corrections due to fluctuations and lateral correlations are discussed. The force of interaction between two adsorbed layers, which is important in understanding colloidal stability, is characterized. The behavior of grafted polymers is also reviewed, both for neutral and charged polymer brushes.},

Importin \beta and related nuclear transport receptors entered such hydrogel >1000x faster than a similarly sized inert macromolecule. The FG-hydrogel even reproduced import signal-dependent and importin-mediated cargo influx, allowing importin \beta to accelerate the gel entry of a large cognate cargo more than 20,000-fold. Intragel diffusion of the importin \beta-cargo complex occurred rapidly enough to traverse an NPC within ≈12 ms. We extend the "selective phase model" to explain these effects. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

  abstract  = {We present a method to probe molecular and nanoparticle diffusion within thin, solvated polymer coatings. The device exploits the confinement with well-defined geometry that forms at the interface between a planar and a hemispherical surface (of which at least one is coated with polymers) in close contact and uses this confinement to analyze diffusion processes without interference of exchange with and diffusion in the bulk solution. With this method, which we call plane-sphere confinement microscopy (PSCM), information regarding the partitioning of molecules between the polymer coating and the bulk liquid is also obtained. Thanks to the shape of the confined geometry, diffusion and partitioning can be mapped as a function of compression and concentration of the coating in a single experiment. The method is versatile and can be integrated with conventional optical microscopes; thus it should find widespread use in the many application areas exploiting functional polymer coatings. We demonstrate the use of PSCM using brushes of natively unfolded nucleoporin domains rich in phenylalanine-glycine repeats (FG domains). A meshwork of FG domains is known to be responsible for the selective transport of nuclear transport receptors (NTRs) and their macromolecular cargos across the nuclear envelope that separates the cytosol and the nucleus of living cells. We find that the selectivity of NTR uptake by FG domain films depends sensitively on FG domain concentration and that the interaction of NTRs with FG domains obstructs NTR movement only moderately. These observations contribute important information to better understand the mechanisms of selective NTR transport.},

The architecture and dynamics of the FG-network have been refractory to characterization due to the paucity of experimental methods able to probe the mobility and density of the FG-polypeptides and embedded macromolecules within intact NPCs. Combining fluorescence polarization, super-resolution microscopy, and mathematical analyses, we examined the rotational mobility of fluorescent probes at various locations within the FG-network under different conditions. We demonstrate that polarization PALM (p-PALM) provides a rich source of information about low rotational mobilities that are inaccessible with bulk fluorescence anisotropy approaches, and anticipate that p-PALM is well-suited to explore numerous crowded cellular environments. In total, our findings indicate that the NPC's internal organization consists of multiple dynamic environments with different local properties.},

The average dimensions of these systems are quantified using the mean radius of gyration and mean end-to-end distance, measured by small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and single-molecule Förster resonance energy transfer (smFRET), respectively, although systematic discrepancies emerge from these measurements. Through holistic sets of studies, we find that the disagreements arise from chemical heterogeneity that is inherent to heteropolymeric systems. This engenders a decoupling between different measures of overall sizes and shapes, thus leading to discrepant inferences based on SAXS vs. smFRET. Our findings point the way forward to obtaining comprehensive descriptions of ensembles of heterogeneous systems.},

  abstract  = {Creating a selective gel that filters particles based on their interactions is a major goal of nanotechnology, with far-reaching implications from drug delivery to controlling assembly pathways. However, this is particularly difficult when the particles are larger than the gel's characteristic mesh size because such particles cannot passively pass through the gel. Thus, filtering requires the interacting particles to transiently reorganize the gel's internal structure. While significant advances, e.g., in DNA engineering, have enabled the design of nano-materials with programmable interactions, it is not clear what physical principles such a designer gel could exploit to achieve selective permeability. We present an equilibrium mechanism where crosslink binding dynamics are affected by interacting particles such that particle diffusion is enhanced. In addition to revealing specific design rules for manufacturing selective gels, our results have the potential to explain the origin of selective permeability in certain biological materials, including the nuclear pore complex. Gels filtering particles by interactions are a goal of nanotechnology; this is difficult when particles are larger than the mesh of the gel. Here, the authors present an equilibrium mechanism where binding dynamics of crosslinks are affected by interacting particles so that particles experience enhanced diffusion.},

  abstract  = {Export of messenger RNA occurs via nuclear pores, which are large nanomachines with diameters of roughly 120 nm that are the only link between the nucleus and cytoplasm. Hence, mRNA export occurs over distances smaller than the optical resolution of conventional light microscopes. There is extensive knowledge on the physical structure and composition of the nuclear pore complex, but transport selectivity and the dynamics of mRNA export at nuclear pores remain unknown. Here we developed a super-registration approach using fluorescence microscopy that can overcome the current limitations of co-localization by means of measuring intermolecular distances of chromatically different fluorescent molecules with nanometre precision. With this method we achieve 20-ms time-precision and at least 26-nm spatial precision, enabling the capture of highly transient interactions in living cells. Using this approach we were able to spatially resolve the kinetics of mRNA transport in mammalian cells and present a three-step model consisting of docking (80 ms), transport (5–20 ms) and release (80 ms), totalling 180 ± 10 ms. Notably, the translocation through the channel was not the rate-limiting step, mRNAs can move bi-directionally in the pore complex and not all pores are equally active.},

  abstract  = {Calnexin is an endoplasmic reticulum-localized molecular chaperone protein which is involved in folding and quality control of proteins. To evaluate the expression of calnexin in soybean seedlings under osmotic stress, immunoblot analysis was performed using a total membrane protein fraction. Calnexin constantly accumulated at an early growth stage of soybean under normal growth conditions. Expression of this protein decreased in 14-day-old soybean roots when treated with 10\% polyethylene glycol for 2 days. Other abiotic stresses such as drought, salinity, cold as well as abscisic acid treatment, similarly reduced accumulation of calnexin and this reduction was correlated with reduction in root length in soybean seedlings under abiotic stresses. When compared between soybean and rice, calnexin expression was not changed in rice under abiotic stresses. Using Flag-tagged calnexin, a 70 kDa heat shock cognate protein was identified as an interacting protein. These results suggest that osmotic or other abiotic stresses highly reduce accumulation of the calnexin protein in developing soybean roots. It is also suggested that calnexin interacts with a 70 kDa heat shock cognate protein and probably functions as molecular chaperone in soybean.},

  abstract  = {We measured the viscosity of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG 6000, 12\,000, 20\,000) in water using capillary electrophoresis and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy with nanoscopic probes of different diameters (from $1.7$ to $114\,\mathrm{nm}$). For a probe of diameter smaller than the radius of gyration of PEG (e.g.\ rhodamine B or lysozyme), the measured nanoviscosity was orders of magnitude smaller than the macroviscosity. For sizes equal to (or larger than) the polymer radius of gyration, the macroscopic value of viscosity was measured. A mathematical relation for macro- and nanoviscosity was found as a function of the PEG radius of gyration, $R_g$, the correlation length in semi-dilute solution, $\xi$, and the probe size, $R$. For $R < R_g$, the nanoviscosity (normalized by water viscosity) is given by $\exp\!\left[b \left(\frac{R}{\xi}\right)^a\right]$, and for $R > R_g$, both nano- and macroviscosity follow the same curve, $\exp\!\left[b \left(\frac{R}{\xi}\right)^a\right]$, where $a$ and $b$ are two constants close to unity. This mathematical relation was shown to equally well describe rhodamine (of size $1.7\,\mathrm{nm}$) in PEG 20\,000 and the macroviscosity of PEG 8\,000\,000, whose radius of gyration exceeds $200\,\mathrm{nm}$. Additionally, for the smallest probes (rhodamine B and lysozyme), we have verified, using capillary electrophoresis and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy, that the Stokes--Einstein (SE) relation holds, provided that we use a size-dependent viscosity in the formula. The SE relation is correct even in PEG solutions of very high viscosity (three orders of magnitude larger than that of water).},

  abstract  = {The hallmark of eukaryotic cells is the nucleus that contains the genome, enclosed by a physical barrier known as the nuclear envelope (NE). On the one hand, this compartmentalization endows the eukaryotic cells with high regulatory complexity and flexibility. On the other hand, it poses a tremendous logistic and energetic problem of transporting millions of molecules per second across the nuclear envelope, to facilitate their biological function in all compartments of the cell. Therefore, eukaryotes have evolved a molecular "nanomachine" known as the Nuclear Pore Complex (NPC). Embedded in the nuclear envelope, NPCs control and regulate all the bi-directional transport between the cell nucleus and the cytoplasm. NPCs combine high molecular specificity of transport with high throughput and speed, and are highly robust with respect to molecular noise and structural perturbations. Remarkably, the functional mechanisms of NPC transport are highly conserved among eukaryotes, from yeast to humans, despite significant differences in the molecular components among various species. The NPC is the largest macromolecular complex in the cell. Yet, despite its significant complexity, it has become clear that its principles of operation can be largely understood based on fundamental physical concepts, as have emerged from a combination of experimental methods of molecular cell biology, biophysics, nanoscience and theoretical and computational modeling. Indeed, many aspects of NPC function can be recapitulated in artificial mimics with a drastically reduced complexity compared to biological pores. We review the current physical understanding of the NPC architecture and function, with the focus on the critical analysis of experimental studies in cells and artificial NPC mimics through the lens of theoretical and computational models. We also discuss the connections between the emerging concepts of NPC operation and other areas of biophysics and bionanotechnology.},

  abstract  = {Nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) form a selective filter that allows the rapid passage of transport factors (TFs) and their cargoes across the nuclear envelope, while blocking the passage of other macromolecules. Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) containing phenylalanyl-glycyl (FG)-rich repeats line the pore and interact with TFs. However, the reason that transport can be both fast and specific remains undetermined, through lack of atomic-scale information on the behavior of FGs and their interaction with TFs. We used nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy to address these issues. We show that FG repeats are highly dynamic IDPs, stabilized by the cellular environment. Fast transport of TFs is supported because the rapid motion of FG motifs allows them to exchange on and off TFs extremely quickly through transient interactions. Because TFs uniquely carry multiple pockets for FG repeats, only they can form the many frequent interactions needed for specific passage between FG repeats to cross the NPC.},

  abstract  = {Membranes have been extensively studied and applied in various fields owing to their high energy efficiency and small environmental impact. Further conferring membranes with stimuli responsiveness can allow them to dynamically tune their pore structure and/or surface properties for efficient separation performance. This review summarizes and discusses important developments and achievements in stimuli-responsive membranes. The most commonly utilized stimuli, including light, pH, temperature, ions, and electric and magnetic fields, are discussed in detail. Special attention is given to stimuli-responsive control of membrane pore structure (pore size and porosity/connectivity) and surface properties (wettability, surface topology, and surface charge), from the perspective of determining the appropriate membrane properties and microstructures. This review also focuses on strategies to prepare stimuli-responsive membranes, including blending, casting, polymerization, self-assembly, and electrospinning. Smart applications for separations are also reviewed as well as a discussion of remaining challenges and future prospects in this exciting field. This review offers critical insights for the membrane and broader materials science communities regarding the on-demand and dynamic control of membrane structures and properties. We hope that this review will inspire the design of novel stimuli-responsive membranes to promote sustainable development and make progress toward commercialization.},

  abstract  = {A supramolecular hydrogel 1, prepared at high concentration (5-10 wt\%), exhibited mechanical toughness comparable to that of a polymer hydrogel, even though the gel was constructed solely by noncovalent bonding interactions among small molecules. The mechanical toughness and thermal reversibility of gel 1 allowed us to fabricate a supramolecular hydrogel capsule (SH-capsule) 1 which was easily handled and was stable in aqueous and cell culture media. The mechanical and substance-release/uptake properties of SH-capsule 1 were investigated by atomic force microscope (AFM) indentation, fluorescence spectroscopy, and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). On the basis of those properties we successfully designed an enzyme- and cell-responsive SH-capsule. To install a function of enzyme-responsive substance release into the SH-capsule 1, enzyme-labile, amphiphilic additive 2 was embedded in supramolecular nanofibers of 1 through a supramolecular co-assembly method. As a proof-of-concept, we constructed the functional SH-capsule 1/2 that can release a model fluorescent drug triggered by prostate specific antigen (PSA)-catalyzed proteolysis. Selective release of the fluorescent substance was exploited to both assay PSA activity and detect prostate cancer (PCa) cells. We also clearly demonstrated that the released fluorescent substance was delivered and internalized into the PCa cells, mediated by binding to the membrane-bound protein prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA), which is over-expressed on a plasma membrane of the PCa cells.},

Applications of stimuli-responsive, or 'smart', polymers in delivery of therapeutics, tissue engineering, bioseparations, sensors or actuators have been studied extensively and numerous papers and patents are evidence of rapid progress in this area.

This selective barrier function is attributed to the behavior of intrinsically disordered phenylalanine-glycine nucleoporins (FG Nups) that guard the NPC channel. However, NPCs in vivo are typically enriched with different Kaps, and how they impact the NPC barrier remains unknown. Here, we show that two major Kaps, importinβ1/karyopherinβ1 (Kapβ1) and exportin 1/chromosomal maintenance 1 (CRM1), are required to fortify NPC barrier function in vivo. Their enrichment at the NPC is sustained by promiscuous binding interactions with the FG Nups, which enable CRM1 to compensate for the loss of Kapβ1 as a means to maintain NPC barrier function. However, such a compensatory mechanism is constrained by the cellular abundances and different binding kinetics for each respective Kap, as evidenced for importin-5. Consequently, we find that NPC malfunction and nucleocytoplasmic leakage result from poor Kap enrichment.},

Dysfunction in nucleocytoplasmic transport is also an emerging theme in physiological aging and other related neurodegenerative diseases, such as Huntington's and Alzheimer's diseases. Here we review transport through the nuclear pore complex, pointing out vulnerabilities that may underlie ALS and potentially contribute to this and other age-related neurodegenerative diseases.

  abstract  = {Nuclear pore complexes play central roles as gatekeepers of RNA and protein transport between the cytoplasm and nucleoplasm. However, their large size and dynamic nature have impeded a full structural and functional elucidation. Here we determined the structure of the entire 552-protein nuclear pore complex of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae at sub-nanometre precision by satisfying a wide range of data relating to the molecular arrangement of its constituents. The nuclear pore complex incorporates sturdy diagonal columns and connector cables attached to these columns, imbuing the structure with strength and flexibility. These cables also tie together all other elements of the nuclear pore complex, including membrane-interacting regions, outer rings and RNA-processing platforms. Inwardly directed anchors create a high density of transport factor-docking Phe-Gly repeats in the central channel, organized into distinct functional units. This integrative structure enables us to rationalize the architecture, transport mechanism and evolutionary origins of the nuclear pore complex. The structure of the yeast nuclear pore complex, determined at sub-nanometre precision using an integrative approach that combines a wide range of data, reveals details of its architecture, transport mechanism and evolutionary origins. Nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) are the gateways for the transport of RNA and proteins into and out of the nucleus. Although previous work has provided structural insights into parts of NPCs, getting a full picture of these complexes has proved difficult owing to their large size and dynamic nature. A multidisciplinary team of researchers now report the structure of the entire 552-protein NPC of the yeast at a sub-nanometre level using an integrative approach including mass spectrometry, cryo-electron tomography and chemical crosslinking. The structure provides a detailed view of the functional elements of the NPC and clarifies its architecture, mechanism of action and evolutionary origins.},

Biomimetic strategies offer new opportunities to investigate this remarkable transport phenomenon2. Here, we show selective transport of proteins across individual biomimetic nuclear pore complexes at the single-molecule level. Each biomimetic complex is constructed by covalently tethering either Nup98 or Nup153 (phenylalanine-glycine (FG) nucleoporins) to a solid-state nanopore3. Individual translocation events are monitored using ionic current measurements with sub-millisecond temporal resolution. Transport receptors (Imp$\beta$) proceed with a dwell time of ~2.5 ms for both Nup98- and Nup153-coated pores, whereas the passage of non-specific proteins is strongly inhibited with different degrees of selectivity. For pores up to ~25 nm in diameter, Nups form a dense and low-conducting barrier, whereas they adopt a more open structure in larger pores. Our biomimetic nuclear pore complex provides a quantitative platform for studying nucleocytoplasmic transport phenomena at the single-molecule level in vitro. Covalently attaching nuclear pore proteins to solid-state nanopores forms a complex that can selectively transport certain proteins, similar to the nuclear pore complex.},

However, all experimental strategies realized so far confined the observation to extremely thin interfacial layers. The detection and characterization of single molecules in three-dimensionally extended systems such as living cells has yet to be accomplished. We show, here, for the first time that single protein molecules can be visualized and tracked in three-dimensional (3D) samples at room temperature. Using a wide-field fluorescence microscope equipped with an Ar+-laser and a low-light-level CCD camera, single molecules of the green fluorescent protein (GFP) were detected in gels and viscous solutions at depths of up to ~10 $\mu$m from the interface. A time resolution of 5 ms was achieved by a high-speed framing mode. The two- dimensional localization accuracy was determined to be ~30 nm. The number of photons emitted by single GFP molecules before photodestruction was found to be ≤ 4 * 105. Freely diffusing GFP molecules could be tracked over up to nine images acquired at a frame rate of ~80 Hz. From the trajectories, the diffusion coefficients of single GFP molecules were derived and found to agree well with expectation and microphotolysis measurements. Our results imply that the visualization and tracking of single molecules in living cells is possible.},

  abstract = {Polymer brushes are attractive as surface coatings for a wide range of applications, from fundamental research to everyday life, and also play important roles in biological systems. How colloids (e.g., functional nanoparticles, proteins, viruses) bind and move across polymer brushes is an important yet under-studied problem. A mean-field theoretical approach is presented to analyze the binding and transport of colloids in planar polymer brushes. The theory explicitly considers the effect of solvent strength on brush conformation and of colloid-polymer affinity on colloid binding and transport. The position-dependent free energy of the colloid insertion into the polymer brush which controls the rate of colloid transport across the brush is derived. It is shown how the properties of the brush can be adjusted for brushes to be highly selective, effectively serving as tuneable gates with respect to colloid size and affinity to the brush-forming polymer. The most important parameter regime simultaneously allowing for high brush permeability and selectivity corresponds to a condition when the repulsive and attractive contributions to the colloid insertion free energy nearly cancel. This theory should be useful to design sensing and purification devices with enhanced selectivity and to better understand mechanisms underpinning the functions of biological polymer brushes.},

  abstract  = {Molecular brushes are composed of a flexible backbone and densely grafted side chains. The conformation of molecular brushes is governed by side chains separated by a distance much smaller than their unperturbed dimensions, which leads to significant monomer congestion and entropically unfavorable extension of both the backbone and side chains. Generally, conformation as well as changes in physical properties of polymers can be influenced by external stimuli, such as solvent, temperature, pH, and light. The mechanisms and driving forces for the conformational variation in response to external stimuli are unique for molecular brushes since these conformational changes can be restricted to a single molecule. In this article, we review the general aspects of molecular brushes and polymeric responsive systems. Rational approaches to induce stimuli-responsiveness in molecular brush systems are highlighted.

  abstract  = {Surface grafting of a polymerizable monomer onto Au was used to produce nanometer-scale planar hydrogel films with controllable volume. A self-assembled monolayer of 11-mercaptoundecanoic acid on a planar Au surface was activated through water-soluble carbodiimide and N-hyroxysuctinimide followed by reaction with 2-aminomethacrylate to produce a methacrylate-terminated surface layer, which readily polymerized under UV radiation in the presence of hydroxyethyl methacrylate monomer, ethylene glycol dimethacrylate cross-linker, and a photoinitiator. The reaction steps were characterized by external reflection mode Fourier transform IR spectroscopy. Under controlled UV exposure, thin (3 nm < d < 10 nm) hydrogel films were obtained from 1:1 ethanol/H 2O. Surface plasmon resonance measurements were used to characterize both the synthesis of the hydrogel and the potential-induced volume changes. The nanometer-scale hydrogels thus produced undergo reproducible changes in thickness, when a potential is applied across the film. Thickness changes increasing with applied potential were obtained for both voltages in the range |V appl| \le 600 mV. In NaCl, electrolyte films swell with application of negative potentials and shrink with positive potentials, due to the imbibing or extrusion of hydrated Na + ions, respectively. Thickness changes as large as 50\% can be achieved. An increase in the cross-linker content results in thicker films, but at the cost of dramatically restricted swelling. Response times are generally faster for smaller applied potentials, as expected if the volume change results from mass transport of electrolyte. (c) 2005 American Chemical Society.},

  abstract  = {Nuclear pore complexes selectively transport cargoes across the nuclear envelope. Now, two studies published in this issue follow the movement of single cargo proteins (Lowe et al.) and mRNA transcripts (David Gr\"unwald and Robert Singer) as they translocate across the nuclear envelope, with nanometre precision and high temporal resolution. They discover previously unidentified transport sub-steps and provide fundamental insight into the mechanism of selective transport through the nuclear pore complexes. Nuclear pore complexes selectively transport cargos across the nuclear envelope. Here, a nuclear transport assay has been developed that allows the movement of single cargo proteins to be followed in real time. A succession of transport substeps is observed, and the NPC is found to be functionally asymmetric to importing cargos. The study provides insight into the mechanism of selective transport through the NPC. The nuclear pore complex (NPC) mediates all exchange between the cytoplasm and the nucleus. Small molecules can passively diffuse through the NPC, whereas larger cargos require transport receptors to translocate1. How the NPC facilitates the translocation of transport receptor/cargo complexes remains unclear. To investigate this process, we tracked single protein-functionalized quantum dot cargos as they moved through human NPCs. Here we show that import proceeds by successive substeps comprising cargo capture, filtering and translocation, and release into the nucleus. Most quantum dots are rejected at one of these steps and return to the cytoplasm, including very large cargos that abort at a size-selective barrier. Cargo movement in the central channel is subdiffusive and cargos that can bind more transport receptors diffuse more freely. Without Ran GTPase, a critical regulator of transport directionality, cargos still explore the entire NPC, but have a markedly reduced probability of exit into the nucleus, suggesting that NPC entry and exit steps are not equivalent and that the pore is functionally asymmetric to importing cargos. The overall selectivity of the NPC seems to arise from the cumulative action of multiple reversible substeps and a final irreversible exit step.},

Whether impβ or RanGTP regulate the permeability of the NPC itself has been unknown. In this study, we identify a stable pool of impβ at the NPC. A subpopulation of this pool is rapidly turned-over by RanGTP, likely at Nup153. Impβ, but not transportin-1 (TRN1), alters the pore's permeability in a Ran-dependent manner, suggesting that impβ is a functional component of the NPC. Upon reduction of Nup153 levels, inert cargos more readily equilibrate across the NPC yet active transport is impaired. When purified impβ or TRN1 are mixed with Nup153 in vitro, higher-order, multivalent complexes form. RanGTP dissolves the impβ•Nup153 complexes but not those of TRN1•Nup153. We propose that impβ and Nup153 interact at the NPC's nuclear face to form a Ran-regulated mesh that modulates NPC permeability.},

The precise mechanism of facilitated translocation remains unclear due to the challenges of measuring the series of transient interactions between a transport receptor and the FG-Nups. This study developed single-point edge-excitation subdiffraction microscopy to obtain a three-dimensional density map of the transient interactions with a spatiotemporal resolution of 9 nm and 400 μs. Three unique features were observed under real-time trafficking conditions that have escaped detection by conventional electron microscopy: (i) the spatial density of interaction sites between Importin \beta1 (Imp \beta1, a major transport receptor) and the FG-Nups gradually increases from both sides of the NPC and is highest in the central pore region; (ii) cargofree or cargo-bound Imp \beta1 rarely occupies an axial channel with a diameter of approximately 10-20 nm at its narrowest point through the NPC; and (iii) the pathway of facilitated translocation through the NPC depends more on the interaction sites of the FG-Nups than on the NPC architecture.},

So far the structural and functional aspects of nuclear pores have been extensively studied, but their distribution and density, which might reflect nuclear organization and function, remain unknown. Here, we report the cell-cycle-dependent dynamics of nuclear pores. Large distinct subdomains lacking nuclear pores are present on the nuclear surface of HeLaS3 cells in early cell-cycle stages. Such `pore-free islands' gradually become dispersed in G1-S phase. Surprisingly, the islands are enriched with inner nuclear membrane proteins lamin A/C and emerin, but exclude lamin B. Lamin-A/C-enriched pore-free islands were also observed in human normal diploid fibroblasts and several cell lines, showing the generality of this phenomenon. Knockdown and ectopic expression analyses demonstrated that lamin A/C, but not emerin, plays an essential structural and regulatory role in the nuclear pore distribution and the formation of pore-free islands. These data thus provide strong evidence that the dynamics of nuclear pores are regulated by the reorganization of inner nuclear structures.},

Here, we applied cryo-electron tomography to human fibroblast cells, reconstructing their nuclear envelopes without applying any purification steps. From these reconstructions, we extracted subtomograms containing individual NPCs and utilized in silico subtomogram averaging procedures to determine the structure of the mammalian pore complex at a resolution of ∼6.6 nm. Beyond revealing the canonical features of the human NPC, our analysis identified inner lateral channels and fusing bridge-like structures, suggesting alternative routes of peripheral nuclear passage. Finally, we concluded from our structural analysis that the human NPC is structurally distinct from that of lower eukaryotes in terms of dimension and organization but resembles its amphibian (frog) counterpart.

Combining single-molecule fluorescence, molecular simulations, and nuclear magnetic resonance, we show that a rapidly fluctuating FG-Nup populates an ensemble of conformations that are prone to bind NTRs with near diffusion-limited on rates, as shown by stopped-flow kinetic measurements. This is achieved using multiple, minimalistic, low-affinity binding motifs that are in rapid exchange when engaging with the NTR, allowing the FG-Nup to maintain an unexpectedly high plasticity in its bound state. We propose that these exceptional physical characteristics enable a rapid and specific transport mechanism in the physiological context, a notion supported by single molecule in-cell assays on intact NPCs.},

We probed the passive barrier of NPCs and observed sieve-like properties with a dominating mesh or channel radius of 2.6 nm, which is narrower than proposed earlier. A small fraction of diffusion channels has a wider opening, explaining the very slow passage of larger molecules. The observed dominant passive diameter approximates the distance of adjacent hydrophobic clusters of FG repeats, supporting the model that the barrier is made of FG repeat domains cross-linked with a spacing of an FG repeat unit length. Wheat germ agglutinin and the dominant-negative importin B 45-462 fragment were previously regarded as selective inhibitors of facilitated NPC passage. We now observed that they do not distinguish between the passive and the facilitated mode. Instead, their inhibitory effect correlates with the size of the NPC-passing molecule. They have little effect on small species, inhibit the passage of green fluorescent protein-sized objects 10-fold and virtually block the translocation of larger ones. This suggests that passive and facilitated NPC passage proceed through one and the same permeability barrier. (c) 2009 European Molecular Biology Organization.},

  abstract  = {Conformational behavior of intrinsically disordered proteins, such as Phe-Gly repeat domains, alters drastically when they are confined in and tethered to, nan channels. This has challenged our understanding of how they serve to selectively facilitate translocation of nuclear transport receptor (NTR)-bearing macromolecules. Heterogeneous FG-repeats, tethered to the NPC interior, nonuniformly fill the channel in a diameter-dependent manner and adopt a rapid Brownian motion, thereby forming a porous and highly dynamic polymeric meshwork that percolates in radial and axial directions and features two distinguishable zones: a dense hydrophobic rod-like zone located in the center and a peripheral low-density shell-like zone. The FG-meshwork is locally disrupted upon interacting with NTR-bearing macromolecules, but immediately reconstructs itself between 0.44 mcs and 7.0 mcs, depending on cargo size and shape. This confers a perpetually-sealed state to the NPC and is solely due to rapid Brownian motion of FG-repeats, not FG-repeat hydrophobic bonds. Elongated-shaped macromolecules, both in the presence and absence of NTRs, penetrate more readily into the FG-meshwork compared to their globular counterparts of identical volume and surface chemistry, highlighting the importance of the shape effects in nucleocytoplasmic transport. These results can help our understanding of geometrical effects in and the design of, intelligent and responsive biopolymer-based materials in nanofiltration and artificial nanopores.},

  abstract  = {Due to its central role in macromolecular trafficking and nucleocytoplasmic information transfer, the nuclear pore complex (NPC) has been studied in great detail using a wide spectrum of methods. Consequently, many aspects of its architecture, general function, and role in the life cycle of a cell are well understood. Over the last decade, fluorescence microscopy methods have enabled the real-time visualization of single molecules interacting with and transiting through the NPC, allowing novel questions to be examined with nanometer precision. While initial single-molecule studies focused primarily on import pathways using permeabilized cells, it has recently proven feasible to investigate the export of mRNAs in living cells. Single-molecule assays can address questions that are difficult or impossible to answer by other means, yet the complexity of nucleocytoplasmic transport requires that interpretation be based on a firm genetic, biochemical, and structural foundation. Moreover, conceptually simple single-molecule experiments remain technically challenging, particularly with regard to signal intensity, signal-to-noise ratio, and the analysis of noise, stochasticity, and precision. We discuss nuclear transport issues recently addressed by single-molecule microscopy, evaluate the limits of existing assays and data, and identify open questions for future studies. We expect that single-molecule fluorescence approaches will continue to be applied to outstanding nucleocytoplasmic transport questions, and that the approaches developed for NPC studies are extendable to additional complex systems and pathways within cells.},

  abstract  = {Transport of macromolecules across the nuclear envelope is an active process that depends on soluble factors including the GTPase Ran. Ran-GTP is predominantly located in the nucleus and has been shown to regulate cargo binding and release of import and export receptors in their respective target compartments. Recently, it was shown that transport of receptor-cargo complexes across the nuclear pore complex (NPC) does not depend on GTP- hydrolysis by Ran; however, the mechanism of translocation is still poorly understood. Here, we show that the direction of transport through the NPC can be inverted in the presence of high concentrations of cytoplasmic Ran-GTP. Under these conditions, two different classes of export cargoes are transported into the nucleus in the absence of GTP hydrolysis. The inverted transport is very rapid and can be blocked by known inhibitors of nuclear protein export. These results suggest that the NPC functions as a facilitated transport channel, allowing the selective translocation of receptor-cargo complexes. We conclude that the directionality of nucleocytoplasmic transport is determined mainly by the compartmentalized distribution of Ran-GTP.},

@article{Ng2023,
  abstract  = {Abstract Nup98 FG repeat domains comprise hydrophobic FG motifs linked through uncharged spacers. FG motifs capture nuclear transport receptors (NTRs) during nuclear pore complex (NPC) passage, confer inter-repeat cohesion, and condense the domains into a selective phase with NPC-typical barrier properties. We show that shortening inter-FG spacers enhances cohesion, increases phase density, and tightens such barrier - all consistent with a sieve-like phase. Phase separation tolerates mutating the Nup98-typical GLFG motifs, provided domain-hydrophobicity remains preserved. NTR-entry, however, is sensitive to (certain) deviations from canonical FG motifs, suggesting co-evolutionary adaptation. Unexpectedly, we observed that arginines promote FG-phase-entry apparently also by hydrophobic interactions/ hydrogen-bonding and not just through cation-π interactions. Although incompatible with NTR·cargo complexes, a YG phase displays remarkable transport selectivity, particularly for engineered GFP NTR -variants. GLFG to FSFG mutations make the FG phase hypercohesive, precluding NTR-entry. Extending spacers relaxes this hypercohesion. Thus, antagonism between cohesion and NTR·FG interactions is key to transport selectivity.},

In this study, we developed an integrated targeted proteomics and super-resolution microscopy approach to determine the absolute stoichiometry of the human nuclear pore complex (NPC), possibly the largest eukaryotic protein complex. We show that the human NPC has a previously unanticipated stoichiometry that varies across cancer cell types, tissues and in disease. Using large-scale proteomics, we provide evidence that more than one third of the known, well-defined nuclear protein complexes display a similar cell type-specific variation of their subunit stoichiometry. Our data point to compositional rearrangement as a widespread mechanism for adapting the functions of molecular machines toward cell type-specific constraints and context-dependent needs, and highlight the need of deeper investigation of such structural variants.},

  abstract  = {The properties of polymer layers end-grafted to the inner surface of nanopores connected to solvent reservoirs are studied theoretically as a function of solvent quality and pore geometry. Our systematic study reveals that nanoconfinement is affected by both pore radius and length and that the conformations of the polymer chains strongly depend on their grafting position along the nanopore and on the quality of the solvent. In poor solvent, polymer chains can collapse to the walls, form a compact plug in the pore, or self-assemble into domains of different shape due to microphase separation. The morphology of these domains (aggregates on pore walls or stacked micelles along the pore axis) is mainly determined by the relationship between chain length and pore radius. In other cases the number of aggregates depends on pore length. The presence of reservoirs decreases confinement at pore edges due to the changes in available volume and introduces new organization strategies not available for infinite nanochannels. In good solvent conditions, chains grafted at the pore entrances stretch out of the pore, relieving the internal osmotic pressure and increasing the entropy of the polymers. Our study also addresses the experimentally relevant case of end-grafted chains on the outer walls of the membrane surrounding the nanopore. The effect of these polymer chains on the organization within the nanopore depends on solvent quality. For good solvents the outer chains increase the confinement of the chains at the entrance of the pore; however, the effect does not result in new structures. For poor solvents the presence of the outer polymer layer may lead to changes in the morphology of the microphase-separated domains. Our results show the complex interplay between the different interactions in a confined environment and the need to develop theoretical and experimental tools for their study.},

@article{Peters2005,
  abstract  = {Translocation through the nuclear pore complex (NPC), a large transporter spanning the nuclear envelope, is a passive, diffusion-driven process, paradoxically enhanced by binding. To account for this mystery, several models have been suggested. However, recent experiments with modified NPCs make reconsideration necessary. Here, we suggest that nuclear transport receptors (NTRs) such as the karyopherins, in accordance with their peculiar boat-like structure, act as nanoscopic ferries transporting cargos through the NPC by sliding on surface of phenylalanine glycine (FG) motifs. The dense array of FG motifs that covers the cytoplasmic filaments of the NPC is thought to continue on the wall of the large channel permeating the central framework of the NPC and on parts of the nuclear filaments to yield a coherent FG surface. Nuclear transport receptors are assumed to bind to the FG surface at filaments or at the channel entrance and then to rapidly search the FG surface by a two-dimensional random walk for the channel exit where they are released. The passage of neutral molecules is restricted to a narrow tube in the center of the central channel by a loose network of peptide chains. The model features virtual gating, is compatible with but not dependent on FG affinity gradients and tolerates deletions and transpositions of FG motifs. Implications of the model are discussed and tests are suggested. Copyright (c) Blackwell Munksgaard 2005.},

However, the conformation of the FG domains in vivo, their arrangement in relation to the transport channel and their function(s) in transport are still vividly debated. Here, we revisit a number of representative transport models - specifically Brownian affinity gating, selective phase gating, reversible FG domain collapse, and reduction of dimensionality (ROD) - in the light of new data obtained by optical single transporter recording, optical superresolution microscopy, artificial nanopores, and many other techniques. The analysis suggests that a properly adapted, simplified version of the ROD model accounts well for the available data. This has implications for nucleocytoplasmic transport in general.

  abstract  = {Nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) allow selective import and export while forming a barrier for untargeted proteins. Using fluorescence microscopy, we measured in vivo the permeability of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae NPC for multidomain proteins of different sizes and found that soluble proteins of 150 kDa and membrane proteins with an extralumenal domain of 90 kDa were still partly localized in the nucleus on a time scale of hours. The NPCs thus form only a weak barrier for the majority of yeast proteins, given their monomeric size. Using FGΔ-mutant strains, we showed that specific combinations of Nups, especially with Nup100, but not the total mass of FG-nups per pore, were important for forming the barrier. Models of the disordered phase of wild-type and mutant NPCs were generated using a one bead per amino acid molecular dynamics model. The permeability measurements correlated with the density predictions from coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations in the center of the NPC. The combined in vivo and computational approach provides a framework for elucidating the structural and functional properties of the permeability barrier of nuclear pore complexes.},

In correlation-averaged CTEM pictures of negatively stained intact NPCs and of distinct NPC components (i.e., "rings," "spoke" complexes, and "plug-spoke" complexes), several fine structural features arranged with octagonal symmetry about a central axis could reproducibly be identified. STEM micrographs of unstained/freeze-dried intact NPCs as well as of their components yielded comparable but less distinct features. Mass determination by STEM revealed the following molecular masses: intact NPC with plug, 124 \pm 11 MD; intact NPC without plug, 112 \pm 11 MD; heavy ring, 32 \pm 5 MD; light ring, 21 \pm 4 MD; plug-spoke complex, 66 \pm 8 MD; and spoke complex, 52 \pm 3 MD. Based on these combined CTEM and STEM data, a three-dimensional model of the NPC exhibiting eightfold centrosymmetry about an axis perpendicular to the plane of the nuclear envelope but asymmetric along this axis is proposed. This structural polarity of the NPC across the nuclear envelope is in accord with its well-documented functional polarity facilitating mediated nucleocytoplasmic exchange of molecules and particles.},

  abstract = {1. A study has been made of the diffusion and filtration of a graded series of molecules (including tritium-labelled water, urea, glucose, antipyrine, sucrose, raffinose, and hemoglobin) in aqueous solution through porous cellulose membranes of three degrees of porosity. 2. Experimental results were in close agreement with predictions based on the membrane pore theory of Pappenheimer et al. (1,2). Restriction to molecular diffusion is a function of pore radius and molecular radius described by equation (11) in the text. Molecular sieving during ultrafiltration is a function of total pore area per unit path length, pore radius, molecular radius, and filtration rate given by equations (16) and (19). 3. Estimates of average pore radius made by means of this theory were considerably larger than estimates made by the method of Elford and Ferry (3) (Table II). Sources of error in the latter method are discussed and a new method of membrane calibration is proposed in which the total cross-sectional area of the pores is measured by direct diffusion of isotope-labelled water. 4. Steady-state osmotic pressures of solutions of sucrose and raffinose measured during molecular sieving through cellulose membranes were found to be close to the "ideal" osmotic pressures calculated by van't Hoff's law. Thus the present experimental data support the methods used by Pappenheimer et al. in their studies on living capillary walls as well as their theory of membrane pore permeability.},

In the presence of different ions the thermoresponse of these coatings is dramatically altered. These effects are complex and poorly understood with no all-inclusive predictive theory of specific ion effects. As natural environments are composed of mixed electrolytes, it is imperative we understand the interplay of different ions for future applications. We hypothesise anion mixtures from the same end of the Hofmeister series (same-type anions) will exhibit non-additive and competitive behaviour. Experiments: The behaviour of POEGMA brushes, synthesised via surface-initiated ARGET-ATRP, in both single and mixed aqueous electrolyte solutions was characterised with ellipsometry and neutron reflectometry as a function of temperature. Findings: In mixed fluoride and chloride aqueous electrolytes (salting-out ions), or mixed thiocyanate and iodide aqueous electrolytes (salting-in ions), a non-monotonic concentration-dependent influence of the two anions on the thermoresponse of the brush was observed.

Therefore, we have taken a comprehensive approach to classify all components of the yeast NPC (nucleoporins). This involved identifying all the proteins present in a highly enriched NPC fraction, determining which of these proteins were nucleoporins, and localizing each nucleoporin within the NPC. Using these data, we present a map of the molecular architecture of the yeast NPC and provide evidence for a Brownian affinity gating mechanism for nucleocytoplasmic transport.},

  abstract  = {Nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) are biological nanomachines that mediate the bidirectional traffic of macromolecules between the cytoplasm and nucleus in eukaryotic cells. This process involves numerous intrinsically disordered, barrier-forming proteins known as phenylalanine-glycine nucleoporins (FG Nups) that are tethered inside each pore. The selective barrier mechanism has so far remained unresolved because the FG Nups have eluded direct structural analysis within NPCs. Here, high-speed atomic force microscopy is used to visualize the nanoscopic spatiotemporal dynamics of FG Nups inside Xenopus laevis oocyte NPCs at timescales of ∼100 ms. Our results show that the cytoplasmic orifice is circumscribed by highly flexible, dynamically fluctuating FG Nups that rapidly elongate and retract, consistent with the diffusive motion of tethered polypeptide chains. On this basis, intermingling FG Nups exhibit transient entanglements in the central channel, but do not cohere into a tightly crosslinked meshwork. Therefore, the basic functional form of the NPC barrier is comprised of highly dynamic FG Nups that manifest as a central plug or transporter when averaged in space and time. High-speed atomic force microscopy can visualize the dynamics of phenylalanine-glycine nucleoporins inside nuclear pore complexes and reveals the selective barrier mechanism within these molecular machines.},

We now observed that Nup98 FG domains of mammals, lancelets, insects, nematodes, fungi, plants, amoebas, ciliates, and excavates spontaneously and rapidly phase-separate from dilute (submicromolar) aqueous solutions into characteristic 'FG particles'. This required neither sophisticated experimental conditions nor auxiliary eukaryotic factors. Instead, it occurred already during FG domain expression in bacteria. All Nup98 FG phases rejected inert macromolecules and yet allowed far larger NTR cargo complexes to rapidly enter. They even recapitulated the observations that large cargo-domains counteract NPC passage of NTR⋅cargo complexes, while cargo shielding and increased NTR⋅cargo surface-ratios override this inhibition. Their exquisite NPC-typical sorting selectivity and strong intrinsic assembly propensity suggest that Nup98 FG phases can form in authentic NPCs and indeed account for the permeability properties of the pore.},

These multi-megadalton structures are composed of about thirty different nucleoporins that are distributed in three main substructures (the inner, cytoplasmic and nucleoplasmic rings) around the central transport channel 4–6 . Here we use cryo-electron tomography on DLD-1 cells that were prepared using cryo-focused-ion-beam milling to generate a structural model for the human NPC in its native environment. We show that—compared with previous human NPC models obtained from purified NEs—the inner ring in our model is substantially wider; the volume of the central channel is increased by 75\% and the nucleoplasmic and cytoplasmic rings are reorganized. Moreover, the NPC membrane exhibits asymmetry around the inner-ring complex. Using targeted degradation of Nup96, a scaffold nucleoporin of the cytoplasmic and nucleoplasmic rings, we observe the interdependence of each ring in modulating the central channel and maintaining membrane asymmetry. Our findings highlight the inherent flexibility of the NPC and suggest that the cellular environment has a considerable influence on NPC dimensions and architecture.},

The approach is predictive, containing no adjustable parameters or postulated underlying dynamic or thermodynamic divergences. Detailed application to hard-sphere colloidal suspensions reveals good agreement with experiment for the location of the kinetic glass transition volume fraction, the dynamic incoherent scattering relaxation time, apparent localization length, and length scale of maximum nongaussian behavior. Multiple connections are predicted between thermodynamics, short-time dynamics in the nearly localized state, and long-time relaxation by entropic barrier crossing. A critical comparison of the fluid volume fraction dependence of the hopping time with fit formulas which contain ideal divergences has been performed. Application of the derivative Stickel analysis suggests that the fit functions do not provide an accurate description over a wide range of volume fractions.

@article{Stewart1998,
  abstract = {Abstract Experimental measurements of effective diffusive permeabilities and effective diffusion coefficients in biofilms are reviewed. Effective diffusive permeabilities, the parameter appropriate to the analysis of reaction-diffusion interactions, depend on solute type and biofilm density. Three categories of solute physical chemistry with distinct diffusive properties were distinguished by the present analysis. In order of descending mean relative effective diffusive permeability (De/Daq) these were inorganic anions or cations (0.56), nonpolar solutes with molecular weights of 44 or less (0.43), and organic solutes of molecular weight greater than 44 (0.29). Effective diffusive permeabilities decrease sharply with increasing biomass volume fraction suggesting a serial resistance model of diffusion in biofilms as proposed by Hinson and Kocher (1996). A conceptual model of biofilm structure is proposed in which each cell is surrounded by a restricted permeability envelope. Effective diffusion coefficients, which are appropriate to the analysis of transient penetration of nonreactive solutes, are generally similar to effective diffusive permeabilities in biofilms of similar composition. In three studies that examine diffusion of very large molecular weight solutes ( > 5000) in biofilms, the average ratio of the relative effective diffusion coefficient of the large solute to the relative effective diffusion coefficient of either sucrose or fluorescein was 0.64, 0.61, and 0.36. It is proposed that large solutes are effectively excluded from microbial cells, that small solutes partition into and diffuse within cells, and that ionic solutes are excluded from cells but exhibit increased diffusive permeability (but decreased effective diffusion coefficients) due to sorption to the biofilm matrix.

Based on the model, a versatile restrictive factor expression was proposed to describe the correlation between the effective diffusivity and the ratio of molecular diameter to pore diameter. Various variations of restrictive factor versus the ratio of molecular diameter to pore diameter from reported literatures were interpreted better than previous restrictive factor equations. Especially, the restrictive factor with non-monotonic variations could not be explained with the reported restrictive factor equations, but interpreted well by equation in this work. Furthermore, the diffusion tortuosity was first proposed herein to account for the effect of molecule diffusion path on diffusion behavior in pores.},

This work reports molecular-theory calculations allowing inhomogeneities in the three spatial dimensions, which allows us to study for the first time off-axis translocation routes, i.e. routes that do not coincide with the axis of the pore. Free-energy landscapes within the pore were obtained for particles of different sizes and affinity for the polymer brush. The minimum free-energy paths on these landscapes determine the translocation routes. Decreasing the size of the particle or increasing its affinity for the polymer, shifts the translocation route from the central axis of the pore towards its walls. Interestingly, for a given polymer-particle affinity, there exists an intermediate particle size that results in the most flat potential of mean force for translocation, therefore, that will optimize the rate of translocation.},

  abstract  = {Nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) are the gateways between a cell's nucleus and its cytoplasm and allow only selected macromolecules to cross the nuclear envelope. Based on an elucidation of the architecture and mechanism of this complex, Jovanovic-Talisman et al. have designed and produced an artificial nanopore membrane that mimics its selectivity. The membrane features the two vital elements of the natural complex - a simple passageway and a lining of proteins, phenylalanine-glycine nucleoporins, familiarly known as 'FG-nups'. As in the natural complex, the artificial nanopores allow only transport factors and transport-factor-carrying cargoes that specifically bind to FG-nups, to pass. This work opens the way to an array of nature-inspired nanodevices that can detect and sort molecules of medical and industrial significance. Nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) serve as gateways between the nucleus and cytoplasm and allow only the transport of selected macromolecules across the nuclear envelope. NPCs are comprised of a scaffold that anchors proteins called FG-nucleoporins, which contain disordered regions that line the inner surface of the pore and extend into the lumen. This study reports the design of an artificial membrane that functions as a selective filter in allowing efficient passage of transport factors and transport factor carrying cargo that specifically bind to FG-nucleoporins. Nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) act as effective and robust gateways between the nucleus and the cytoplasm, selecting for the passage of particular macromolecules across the nuclear envelope. NPCs comprise an elaborate scaffold that defines a ~30 nm diameter passageway connecting the nucleus and the cytoplasm. This scaffold anchors proteins termed 'phenylalanine-glycine' (FG)-nucleoporins, the natively disordered domains of which line the passageway and extend into its lumen1. Passive diffusion through this lined passageway is hindered in a size-dependent manner. However, transport factors and their cargo-bound complexes overcome this restriction by transient binding to the FG-nucleoporins2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10. To test whether a simple passageway and a lining of transport-factor-binding FG-nucleoporins are sufficient for selective transport, we designed a functionalized membrane that incorporates just these two elements. Here we demonstrate that this membrane functions as a nanoselective filter, efficiently passing transport factors and transport-factor-cargo complexes that specifically bind FG-nucleoporins, while significantly inhibiting the passage of proteins that do not. This inhibition is greatly enhanced when transport factor is present. Determinants of selectivity include the passageway diameter, the length of the nanopore region coated with FG-nucleoporins, the binding strength to FG-nucleoporins, and the antagonistic effect of transport factors on the passage of proteins that do not specifically bind FG-nucleoporins. We show that this artificial system faithfully reproduces key features of trafficking through the NPC, including transport-factor-mediated cargo import.},

The structural details of NPCs vary across species, with many of their constituent proteins exhibiting relatively low sequence conservation; yet the NPC as a whole retains its general architecture and mechanism of action in all eukaryotes from yeast to humans. This functional conservation in the absence of precise molecular conservation suggests that many aspects of the NPC transport mechanism may be understood based on general biophysical considerations. Accordingly, some aspects of NPC function have been recapitulated in artificial nanochannel mimics, even though they lack certain molecular elements of the endogenous NPC. Herein, we review biophysical aspects of NPC architecture and function and cover recent progress in the field. We also review recent advances in man-made molecular filters inspired by NPCs, and their applications in nanotechnology.

Using thousands of independent time-resolved fluorescence microscopy measurements in vivo, we show that the NPC lacks such a firm size threshold; instead, it forms a soft barrier to passive diffusion that intensifies gradually with increasing molecular mass in both the wild-type and mutant strains with various subsets of phenylalanine-glycine (FG) domains and different levels of baseline passive permeability. Brownian dynamics simulations replicate these findings and indicate that the soft barrier results from the highly dynamic FG repeat domains and the diffusing macromolecules mutually constraining and competing for available volume in the interior of the NPC, setting up entropic repulsion forces. We found that FG domains with exceptionally high net charge and low hydropathy near the cytoplasmic end of the central channel contribute more strongly to obstruction of passive diffusion than to facilitated transport, revealing a compartmentalized functional arrangement within the NPC.},

  abstract  = {Molecular traffic between the cytoplasm and the nucleoplasm of eukaryotic cells is mediated by nuclear pore complexes (NPCs). Hundreds, if not thousands, of molecules interact with and transit through each NPC every second. The pore is blocked by a permeability barrier, which consists of a network of intrinsically unfolded polypeptides containing thousands of phenylalanine-glycine (FG) repeat motifs. This FG-network rejects larger molecules and admits smaller molecules or cargos bound to nuclear transport receptors (NTRs). For a cargo transport complex, minimally consisting of a cargo molecule plus an NTR, access to the permeability barrier is provided by interactions between the NTR and the FG repeat motifs. Numerous models have been postulated to explain the controlled accessibility and the transport characteristics of the FG-network, but the amorphous, flexible nature of this structure has hindered characterization. A relatively recent development is the ability to monitor the real-time movement of single molecules through individual NPCs via single molecule fluorescence (SMF) microscopy. A major advantage of this approach is that it can be used to continuously monitor a series of specific molecular interactions in an active pore with millisecond time resolution, which therefore allows one to distinguish between kinetic and thermodynamic control. Novel insights and prospects for the future are outlined in this review.

  abstract  = {The formation and properties of smart (stimuli-responsive) membranes are reviewed, with a special focus on temperature and pH triggering of gating to water, ions, polymers, nanoparticles, or other molecules of interest. The review is organized in two parts, starting with all-smart membranes based on intrinsically smart materials, in particular of the poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) family and similar polymers. The key steps of membrane fabrication are discussed, namely the deposition into thin films, functionalization of pores, and the secondary crosslinking of pre-existing microgel particles into membranes. The latter may be free-standing and do not necessitate the presence of a porous support layer. The temperature-dependent swelling properties of polymers provide a means of controlling the size of pores, and thus size-sensitive gating. Throughout the review, we highlight "positive" (gates open) or "negative" (closed) gating effects with respect to increasing temperature. In the second part, the functionalization of porous organic or inorganic membranes of various origins by either microgel particles or linear polymer brushes is discussed. In this case, the key steps are the adsorption or grafting mechanisms. Finally, whenever provided by the authors, the suitability of smart gating membranes for specific applications is highlighted.},

To understand how NPC density and organization are controlled, we analyzed the NPC number and distribution in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe using structured illumination microscopy. The small size of yeast nuclei, genetic features of fungi, and our robust image analysis pipeline allowed us to study NPCs in intact nuclei under multiple conditions. Our data revealed that NPC density is maintained across a wide range of nuclear sizes. Regions of reduced NPC density are observed over the nucleolus and surrounding the spindle pole body (SPB). Lem2-mediated tethering of the centromeres to the SPB is required to maintain NPC exclusion near SPBs. These findings provide a quantitative understanding of NPC number and distribution in S. pombe and show that interactions between the centromere and the nuclear envelope influences local NPC distribution.},

  abstract  = {Abstract High pressure high temperature processing is a candidate food sterilization process in which heat is generated volumetrically within the food as a result of rapid pressurization to 600 MPa or higher. For commercial viability the temperature profile in the process should be as uniform as possible. A model has been developed to predict the flow and temperature fields inside a pilot scale (35 L) vessel during the pressure heating, holding and cooling stages of the process. Simulations on the empty vessel show that thermal conduction causes excessive cooling. The model agrees well with experimental results in which thermocouples are used to measure temperature throughout a metallic composite carrier inserted into the vessel. The model is used to design a Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) carrier which produces thermal uniformity within the carrier. Predicted variations of sterility resulting from a process are produced using the F 0 -value distribution. No significant reduction of spores was seen in the empty vessel, while more than 94.6\% of the PTFE carrier volume achieved a reduction greater than 10 12 . © 2007 American Institute of Chemical Engineers AIChE J, 2007},

The transport of materials between the nucleus and cytoplasm in eukaryotic cells is controlled by the nuclear pore complex. Martin Beck and colleagues have used cryo-electron tomography, mass spectrometry and other analyses to generate the most comprehensive architectural model of the human nuclear pore complex to date. The model reveals previously unknown local interactions, and a role for the transport channel nucleoporin 358 (Nup358) in mediating oligomerization of the Y-complex within the nuclear pore complex. Nuclear pore complexes are fundamental components of all eukaryotic cells that mediate nucleocytoplasmic exchange. Determining their 110-megadalton structure imposes a formidable challenge and requires in situ structural biology approaches. Of approximately 30 nucleoporins (Nups), 15 are structured and form the Y and inner-ring complexes. These two major scaffolding modules assemble in multiple copies into an eight-fold rotationally symmetric structure that fuses the inner and outer nuclear membranes to form a central channel of ~60 nm in diameter1. The scaffold is decorated with transport-channel Nups that often contain phenylalanine-repeat sequences and mediate the interaction with cargo complexes. Although the architectural arrangement of parts of the Y complex has been elucidated, it is unclear how exactly it oligomerizes in situ. Here we combine cryo-electron tomography with mass spectrometry, biochemical analysis, perturbation experiments and structural modelling to generate, to our knowledge, the most comprehensive architectural model of the human nuclear pore complex to date. Our data suggest previously unknown protein interfaces across Y complexes and to inner-ring complex members. We show that the transport-channel Nup358 (also known as Ranbp2) has a previously unanticipated role in Y-complex oligomerization. Our findings blur the established boundaries between scaffold and transport-channel Nups. We conclude that, similar to coated vesicles, several copies of the same structural building block - although compositionally identical - engage in different local sets of interactions and conformations.},

The centerpiece of NPC transport is the assembly of intrinsically disordered polypeptides, known as FG nucleoporins, lining its passageway. Their conformations and collective dynamics during transport are difficult to assess in vivo. In vitro investigations provide partially conflicting results, lending support to different models of transport, which invoke various conformational transitions of the FG nucleoporins induced by the cargo-carrying transport proteins. We show that the spatial organization of FG nucleoporin assemblies with the transport proteins can be understood within a first principles biophysical model with a minimal number of key physical variables, such as the average protein interaction strengths and spatial densities. These results address some of the outstanding controversies and suggest how molecularly divergent NPCs in different species can perform essentially the same function.},

An explanation is offered for the apparent discrepancy between the width of pores in sections perpendicular to the nuclear envelope and the width of cross-sections of the pore complex in tangential sections. Channels associated with the pore complex extend deep into the nucleus. Although crescents and spirals of ribonucleoprotein particles were often seen in the immediate vicinity of the outer nuclear membrane, direct association with the pore complex was not observed.

Nuclei of 32 haploid cells at various points in the cell cycle were modeled and found to contain between 65 and 182 NPCs. Morphological markers, such as cell shape and nuclear shape, were used to determine the cell cycle stage of the cell being examined. NPC number was correlated with cell cycle stage to reveal that the number of NPCs increases steadily, beginning in G 1 -phase, suggesting that NPC assembly occurs continuously throughout the cell cycle. However, the accumulation of nuclear envelope observed during the cell cycle, indicated by nuclear surface area, is not continuous at the same rate, such that the density of NPCs per unit area of nuclear envelope peaks in apparent S-phase cells. Analysis of the nuclear envelope reconstructions also revealed no preferred NPC-to-NPC distance. However, NPCs were found in large clusters over regions of the nuclear envelope. Interestingly, clusters of NPCs were most pronounced in early mitotic nuclei and were found to be associated with the spindle pole bodies, but the functional significance of this association is unknown.},

  abstract  = {We propose a statistical dynamical theory for the violation of the hydrodynamic Stokes-Einstein (SE) diffusion law for a spherical nanoparticle in entangled and unentangled polymer melts based on a combination of mode coupling, Brownian motion, and polymer physics ideas. The non-hydrodynamic friction coefficient is related to microscopic equilibrium structure and the length-scale-dependent polymer melt collective density fluctuation relaxation time. When local packing correlations are neglected, analytic scaling laws (with numerical prefactors) in various regimes are derived for the non-hydrodynamic diffusivity as a function of particle size, polymer radius-of-gyration, tube diameter, degree of entanglement, melt density, and temperature. Entanglement effects are the origin of large SE violations (orders of magnitude mobility enhancement) which smoothly increase as the ratio of particle radius to tube diameter decreases. Various crossover conditions for the recovery of the SE law are derived, which are qualitatively distinct for unentangled and entangled melts. The dynamical influence of packing correlations due to both repulsive and interfacial attractive forces is investigated. A central finding is that melt packing fraction, temperature, and interfacial attraction strength all influence the SE violation in qualitatively different directions depending on whether the polymers are entangled or not. Entangled systems exhibit seemingly anomalous trends as a function of these variables as a consequence of the non-diffusive nature of collective density fluctuation relaxation and the different response of polymer-particle structural correlations to adsorption on the mesoscopic entanglement length scale. The theory is in surprisingly good agreement with recent melt experiments, and new parametric studies are suggested.},

  abstract  = {We theoretically study the diffusion of a single attractive nanoparticle (NP) in unentangled and entangled polymer melts based on combining microscopic "core-shell" and "vehicle" mechanisms in a dynamic bond percolation theory framework. A physical picture is constructed which addresses the role of chain length (N), degree of entanglement, nanoparticle size, and NP-polymer attraction strength. The nanoparticle diffusion constant is predicted to initially decrease with N due to the dominance of the core-shell mechanism, then to cross over to the vehicle diffusion regime with a weaker N dependence, and eventually plateau at large enough N. This behavior corresponds to decoupling of NP diffusivity from the macroscopic melt viscosity, which is reminiscent of repulsive NPs in entangled melts, but here it occurs for a distinct physical reason. Specifically, it reflects a crossover to a transport mechanism whereby nanoparticles adsorb on polymer chains and diffuse using them as "vehicles" over a characteristic desorption time scale. Repetition of random desorption events then leads to Fickian long time NP diffusion. Complementary simulations for a range of chain lengths and low to moderate NP-polymer attraction strengths are also performed. They allow testing of the proposed diffusion mechanisms and qualitatively support the theoretically predicted dynamic crossover behavior. When the desorption time is smaller than or comparable to the onset of entangled polymer dynamics, the NP diffusivity becomes almost chain length independent.},

In addition, a cylindrical transporter is located centrally within the spokes and exhibits a variable radial expansion in projection that may reflect gating. The inner spoke ring, a transmembrane spoke domain, and the transporter are conserved between yeast and vertebrates; hence, they are required to form a functional NPC.

However, the size and complexity of NPCs have made it difficult to clearly define the loci and kinetics of the cofactor-NPC interactions required for transport. We now report the use of single-molecule fluorescence microscopy to directly monitor a model protein substrate undergoing transport through NPCs in permeabilized cells. This substrate, NLS-2xGFP, interacts with NPCs for an average of $10 \pm 1$ ms during transport. However, because the maximum nuclear accumulation rate of NLS-2xGFP was measured to be at least $\approx 10^3$ molecules per NPC per s, NPCs must be capable of transporting at least $\approx 10$ substrate molecules simultaneously. Molecular tracking reveals that substrate molecules spend most of their transit time randomly moving in the central pore of the NPC and that the rate-limiting step is escape from the central pore.},

The hydrogels were formed by the intermolecular cross-linking of carboxymethyl dextran (CM-dextran) using 1-ethyl-(3-3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) and N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS). Infrared spectra of the hydrogels suggest the formation of ester bonds between the hydroxyl and carboxyl groups in the CM-dextran. The porosity of the hydrogels produced, as shown by protein diffusion, increases in response to changes in the pH and the ionic strength of the external medium. The results show pH-dependent swelling behaviour arising from the acidic pedant groups in the polymer network. The diffusion of the protein lysozyme through the hydrogel membranes increased with increases in both pH (5.0-9.0) and ionic strength. The effect of changes of pH and ionic strength on the hydrogel's permeability was shown to be reversible. Scanning electron microscopy of these hydrogels showed that pH-dependent changes in permeability are mirrored by morphological changes in gel structure. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

@article{Zheng2023,
  abstract  = {Nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) are the main conduits for macromolecular transport into and out of the nucleus of eukaryotic cells. The central component of the NPC transport mechanism is an assembly of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) that fills the NPC channel. The channel interior is further crowded by large numbers of simultaneously translocating cargo-carrying and free transport proteins. How the NPC can efficiently, rapidly, and selectively transport varied cargoes in such crowded conditions remains ill understood. Past experimental results suggest that the NPC is surprisingly resistant to clogging and that transport may even become faster and more efficient as the concentration of transport protein increases. To understand the mechanisms behind these puzzling observations, we construct a computational model of the NPC comprising only a minimal set of commonly accepted consensus features. This model qualitatively reproduces the previous experimental results and identifies self-regulating mechanisms that relieve crowding. We show that some of the crowding-alleviating mechanisms—such as preventing saturation of the bulk flux—are “robust” and rely on very general properties of crowded dynamics in confined channels, pertaining to a broad class of selective transport nanopores. By contrast, the counterintuitive ability of the NPC to leverage crowding to achieve more efficient single-molecule translocation is “fine-tuned” and relies on the particular spatial architecture of the IDP assembly in the NPC channel.},

  abstract = {A theory that has been developed as an average field approximation describes the structure and conformations of chains consisting of long semirigid polymer chains grafted to an impermeable plane surface. The chains are immersed in a solvent and under the dense grafting conditions there is a marked degree of overlapping of individual chains. Analytical expressions have been derived to describe the density profile for units in the layer, the distribution of chain ends along the layer height and the distribution of local elongation in particular chains. The conformational transition due to collapse of the layer when the temperature falls (deterioration of the solvent quality) has been investigated. In contradistinction to a coil-globule transition occurring in an isolated macromolecule the transition studied is not a true thermodynamic phase transition. {\textcopyright} 1990.},

The key component of the functional architecture of the NPC is the assembly of intrinsically disordered proteins that line its passageway and play a central role in the NPC transport mechanism. Due to paucity of experimental methods capable to directly probe the morphology of this assembly in intact NPCs, much of our knowledge about its properties derives from in vitro experiments augmented by theoretical and computational modeling. I review the major insights into the biophysics of the assemblies of the intrinsically disordered proteins of the NPC arising from the theoretical analysis of the recent in vitro experimental results, with the emphasis on the phase separation and aggregation phenomena.},

These giant channels in the nuclear envelope mediate nucleocytoplasmic exchange. Zimmerli et al . show that the mechanical status of the nuclear membranes controls their nuclear pore diameter. Pulling forces imposed through nuclear membranes lead to stretching of NPCs and dilation of their diameter, whereas relief of such forces causes NPC constriction. Thus, the control of nuclear size and shape is functionally linked with NPC conformation and nucleocytoplasmic transport activity. —SMH},
